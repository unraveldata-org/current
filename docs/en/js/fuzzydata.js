In summary, problems solved by Unravel: APM for Big Data AI for DataOps Cloud Migration Resource and Cost Optimization Troubleshooting and Root Cause Analysis Where Does Unravel Reside Unravel Server is positioned in a Hadoop cluster on its own Gateway\/Edge node to communicate with HDFS and TaskTracker nodes, and to enable client access to Unravel Web UI. A basic deployment takes two hours or less. You can deploy Unravel to preserve business continuity after a disruptive event. install-HA-deploy Once deployed, Unravel Server begins to collect information from relevant services like YARN, Hive, Oozie, Spark, Pig, and MapReduce jobs via HDFS. Unravel analyzes this information and store its analyses in its database. Unravel Web UI displays information from the database, as well as real-time event streams it receives directly from Unravel Server. After deployment, advanced setup steps are optional, but may include: Deploying Unravel Sensors for Hive and Spark, which can push additional metadata to Unravel Server. In YARN, enabling log aggregation. In Oozie, pushing information via the Oozie REST API. Installing OnDemand for report generation. " },

Unsupported All On-Demand Features Sessions Reports Capacity Forecasting Migration Planning Cluster Optimization File Reports Queue Analysis Small Files Top X Unravel for Azure Databricks AutoActions Incorporating true “workflows”, i.e., Databricks jobs orchestration via services like ADF. We have not examined the functionality provided by Cluster Pools and how it can affect Unravel functionality. No support for \"interactive clusters\"; only Job clusters supported including when New Job Clusters are created. The following have not been tried out\/tested. Connecting to a Hive Metastore which populates parts of the Data Insights tab. Behavior on setting Maximum Concurrent Runs value to > 1. Spark streaming applications. Unravel's APIs Unravel for EMR and Unravel for HDInsight ATSv2.0 Head node HA. YARN aggregate logs are not captured for MR jobs. Therefore, the Logs tab for MR jobs is empty. Information in the Errors tab which is derived from the logs isn't available. AutoActions Kill and move actions. (AA-103) Rules that span across multiple clusters, i.e., you can not specify a rule that aggregates metrics from multiple clusters and monitor its violation. (AA-131) AMI\/CFN\/ARM Template based installation support. No special support for cloud-native constructs, e.g., IAM roles for RBAC etc. Multi-Metastore This is an unsupported scenario - When a cluster has more than one metastore or if an external metastore is used (as opposed to the one that comes default with the cluster). Also, the Unravel node, at a given time, can retrieve data from one metastore (it needs to be configured as described in ). Workflows Airflow Marketplace (both Azure and AWS) has older versions of Unravel, not this current 4.5.2.0 cloud release. Unravel for HDInsight Automatic configuration when Kafka cluster scales up\/down. Linking Spark Streaming app topic to Kafka page. New Features and improvements Unravel for Azure Databricks Currently Only “Job clusters” are supported so there is no support for “interactive clusters”. Unravel is focusing on Data Engineering Use Cases only and not ad hoc usage. Job types supported (with “New Cluster” option only): Notebook, Jar, spark-submit, and Python Task. See Known Issues for current limitations. Unravel for EMR and Unravel for HDInsight AutoActions are supported and enforced across multiple clusters, including the Collection and aggregation of metrics across multiple clusters connected to an Unravel server as well as transient clusters. See here for currently unsupported aspects. Metrics are collected and routed to a new AutoAction daemon which be stopped and started any time. SparkSQL support Data insights tab S3A file system metrics is now supported for EMR\/HDI. Unravel for EMR Support for auto-scaling clusters (or clusters scaling up without the need for manual intervention). Unravel for HDInsight ADLS Gen 2 Storage Type is supported. Ability to specify multiple ADLS Gen 1 Storage Accounts. Known issues Unravel Azure Databricks Operations The Apps Running and Apps Pending count is not correct on the Operations page. (DT-119) Applications Applications details view The Timeline view of tasks only shows the job type Spark-Submit. This is because the Event Logs are not available for other job types. In the very first horizontal section The right panel tabs ( Program , Task Attempts , Resource ) are shown even if there is no data. Sometimes you may see a notice about missing data. Intermittently the Navigation tab may have jobs with incomplete stage information. (DT-201) Cluster Name and Cluster ID tooltips are incorrectly exchanged. (DT-204) App Name value appears as “Databricks Shell” (class name instead of the last run_name) when jobs are submitted as Spark jar tasks, Notebook tasks and Python tasks. (DT-179, DT-176) In some cases the Spark SQL query text and query plan mismatch. (DT-186) When there are driver side exceptions in spark-submit application, the status is still captured as SUCCESS. It is difficult to capture driver side exceptions because they are not being logged in driver log by Databricks. (DT-192) When a Python script is executed as a spark-submit task with eventLog enabled it becomes stuck forever. This is a bug at Databricks end which we have raised in the databricks forum . Workaround is to not enable eventLog for spark-submit task which runs the Python script. Filter by Application Name has issues when it has special characters like hyphen etc. By default, the spark.app.name has hyphens (e.g. app-20190712214639-0000). So this will be an issue with a majority of Spark applications in Databricks. (DT-200) When a running job is cancelled forcefully than the application status is unpredictable as Unravel doesn't get enough time to send messages from Brace. (DT-202) Jobs > Details View (DT-195) Jobs are labeled as Workflow in several places instead of Job The number of jobs is labeled as # of YARN Apps instead of # OF Apps ”.(DT-195). Tagging Unravel Tagging feature as described here, is not supported. This affects RBAC as well. Data Insights (Reports > Data Insights > Overview) Accessed Partitions Section is empty. (DT-175) Miscellaneous For spark-submit job, the Databricks’s default Spark extraJavaOptions are overwritten by Unravel's extraJavaOptions that required for monitoring. (DT-113) Application count is incorrect on Operations page. (DT-119) The Graphs tab is intermittently missing.(DT-209) Unravel for EMR, Unravel for HDInsight AutoActions In multi-cluster configurations AutoActions does not differentiate between entities of each cluster and setting up a policy targets all monitored clusters. For instance, setting up a rule to target root queue causes it to be monitored on all clusters. (AA-174) Workaround: If the cluster ID is known isolate the policy for the cluster using policy options. Uses the internal Hadoop cluster ID instead of Unravel cluster ID\/name. You must obtain the internal cluster ID in order to specify a Hadoop cluster in the policy options section. It can be obtained from HDFS namenode, where it’s stored in {dfs.namenode.name.dir}\/current\/VERSION. (AA-150) In case of transport message protocol synchronization error, n exceptionally rare occasion AutoAction can be triggered up to 180 seconds after the violation occurs. No data loss is expected. “RECENT EVENTS & ALERTS” shows the events across all clusters regardless of the currently selected cluster. (AA-127, AA-151) Application Master level metrics, such as job metrics and job counters, are not collected by EMR sensor by default and therefore can not be used in AA policies. Collection of AM metrics can be enabled manually using “am-polling” option in EMR sensor. (AA-184) In exceptionally rare cases AutoActions can be triggered up to 180 seconds later in case of transport message protocol synchronization error but no data loss is expected. Data insights page Table size will be shown as 0 if data is in object storage. (DATAPAGE-104) Created and Accessed Partition details are missing. (DATAPAGE-109) Retention Table details shows number partitions as zero (0). (DATAPAGE-98) HBase Spaces in names are missing in HBase table name. (UIX-1736) MySQL Exception in unravel_jcse2 , unravel_td and unravel_ja.log with external MYSQL8.0.

(TEZLLAP-274) For Hive-Tez, the event \"TEZ DAG VERTEX USED TOO MANY REDUCER TASKS\" incorrectly reports the current value for 'hive.exec.reducers.bytes.per.reducer' as 67108864 when the configured value is less than 67108864. (TEZLLAP-282) UI Search behavior is not consistent behavior across all search options\/boxes.

(DT-192) When a Python script is executed as a spark-submit task with eventLog enabled it becomes stuck forever. This is a bug at Databricks end which we have raised in the databricks forum . Workaround is to not enable eventLog for spark-submit task which runs the Python script. Filter by Application Name has issues when it has special characters like hyphen etc. By default, the spark.app.name has hyphens (e.g. app-20190712214639-0000). So this will be an issue with a majority of Spark applications in Databricks. (DT-200) Data Insights page Table size will be shown as 0 if data is in object storage. (DATAPAGE-104) Accessed Partitions Section is empty. (DT-175) Miscellaneous For spark-submit job, the Databricks’s default Spark extraJavaOptions are overwritten by Unravel's extraJavaOptions that required for monitoring. (DT-113) Application count is incorrect on Operations page. (DT-119) Unravel for EMR Clusters created without Unravel bootstrap and have auto-scaling setup are not supported. (EMR-83) Unravel for Google Cloud Dataproc Clusters created without Unravel Initialization actions and have auto-scaling setup are not supported. (DTP-9) Unravel for EMR, Unravel for HDInsight, and Unravel for Google Cloud Dataproc AutoActions In multi-cluster configurations AutoActions does not differentiate between entities of each cluster and setting up a policy targets all monitored clusters. For instance, setting up a rule to target root queue causes it to be monitored on all clusters. (AA-174) Workaround: If the cluster ID is known isolate the policy for the cluster using policy options. Uses the internal Hadoop cluster ID instead of Unravel cluster ID\/name. You must obtain the internal cluster ID in order to specify a Hadoop cluster in the policy options section. It can be obtained from HDFS namenode, where it’s stored in {dfs.namenode.name.dir}\/current\/VERSION. (AA-150) In case of transport message protocol synchronization error, n exceptionally rare occasion AutoAction can be triggered up to 180 seconds after the violation occurs. No data loss is expected. “RECENT EVENTS & ALERTS” shows the events across all clusters regardless of the currently selected cluster. (AA-127, AA-151) Application Master level metrics, such as job metrics and job counters, are not collected by EMR sensor by default and therefore can not be used in AA policies. Collection of AM metrics can be enabled manually using “am-polling” option in EMR sensor. (AA-184) In exceptionally rare cases AutoActions can be triggered up to 180 seconds later in case of transport message protocol synchronization error but no data loss is expected. Data insights page Table size will be shown as 0 if data is in object storage. (DATAPAGE-104) Created and Accessed Partition details are missing. (DATAPAGE-109) Retention Table details shows number partitions as zero (0). (DATAPAGE-98) HBase Spaces in names are missing in HBase table name. (UIX-1736) MySQL Exception in unravel_jcse2 , unravel_td and unravel_ja.log with external MYSQL8.0.

Hive Hive table details page parameters are inconsistently null. (UIX-1874) Timestamp is missing for Failed MR apps. (UIX-1873) Impala chargeback page does not show data for queries migrated from Unravel 4.3.1.x. Kafka is not working when clusterID has a space. (UKAFKA-69) Migration planning Migration Planning Reports are not supported for MapR. The following Cloud Product\/Service configurations are not supported: Cloud Product\/Service : GCP Storage Type : Persistent Disks Region : asia Cloud Product\/Service : GCP Storage Type : Cloud Storage Region : asia-east1, asia, europe-north1, europe, australia, us-west1, asia-east, asia-southeast, and europe-west4 Cloud Product\/Service : EMR and EC2 Storage Type : S3, EBS General Purpose Region : Asia Pacific (Hong Kong) Cloud Mapping per Instance report displays “unsupported operand type” error message when Unravel is unable to map the host to any VM instance. (REPORT-729) Unlike the Cluster Discovery report the Cloud Mapping per Host report displays the cluster ID. (REPORT-698) Cloud Mapping per Host report for Azure HDI and Azure (IaaS) cloud providers Unravel displays on-prem storage as total storage value and not the actual storage made available by Azure Managed Disks when Storage Type chosen is ‘Local Attached Storage’. (REPORT-728) Cloud Product\/Service name displayed in the reports for Cloud Mapping per Host and Cloud Mapping per Instance are not the complete names of the Cloud Product\/Service provider. (REPORT-567) Downloaded JSON file for cloud mapping per host and cloud mapping instance display info on Workload fit which is currently not supported.

(REPORT-731) Actual usage value utilized for figuring out cloud mapping for ‘Cost Reduction’ Strategy is based on last 6 days only of usage. When Storage Type selected is Object Storage, the minimum disk space required on nodes is ignored when generating the cloud mapping. (REPORT-661) There is no ability to pick the time for the Cluster Discovery Report (you can pick only the date). The time that gets chosen (automatically) does not match the time (automatically) picked for the Chargeback reports. So the data in the charts displayed By App Type , By User and By Queue on the Cluster Discovery Report don’t match the ones on the Chargeback reports. (REPORT-684) The regions for Google Cloud Provider display extra regions Asia, Europe, US, Australia which should not be listed. (REPORT-663) Object storage pricing is typically tiered, but is not taken into account while calculating the storage costs. (REPORT-596) Unravel assumes one on-prem core is equivalent to one cloud vCPU and finds the best possible match without taking into account any performance differences. (CUSTOMER-926) MR : The Move to Queue option in Actions (MR APM) does not work. (PLATFORM-1195) Cluster ID missing for MR apps. (PLATFORM-1434) Platform appstatus.AppInfoAccessor: Unable to update ES document. (CUSTOMER-658) Spark worker is missing Azure libraries which causes failure when loading event log and executor logs from Azure. RM Polling is delayed when yarn kill and move actions are enabled in AutoActions. Setting impalad as Impala data source raises errors for invalid HTTP address. (PLATFORM-1444) Security LDAP upgrade configs script not updating hive.server2.auth.ldap.base property to com.unraveldata.ldap.baseDN property. (INSTALL-170) Queue analysis : Graph zooming and resetting is not working properly in Edge. (UIX-158) Sessions Limitation in HDP cluster: While applying on a Spark session sometimes we get error like “Could not run the Spark application on the cluster: java.lang.IllegalStateException: hdp.version is not set while running Spark under HDP, please set through HDP_VERSION in spark-env.sh or add a java-opts file in conf with -Dhdp.version=xxx”. The exact reason for this bug is yet to be ascertained. Workaround Open and edit spark-env.sh of the client where unravel is running. Add a line similar to export “HDP_VERSION=2.6.5.0-292\" . Make sure to put the proper hdp version in the line. In a MapR cluster, Spark application's fail after turning recommendations are applied. (SESS-250) Hive: Newly tuned app in MapR is not shown after applying recommendations. (SESS-251) Small files Does not work when sentry is enabled in the cluster. (REPORT-323) Spark Load logs : Yarn logs might not get loaded if event logs are not loaded and sensor data is not available. Spark SQL apps are missing data. (USPARK-310) Note: Upgrading the sensor fixes this issue. Tez : Vertex name is null. (TEZLLAP-227) Top X report Hive-on-Tez and Hive-on-Spark apps show vCore seconds and memory seconds values as zero. (TEZLLAP-249) Workflow : name search is case-sensitive.

"body" : "Unsupported ATSv2.0. Small Files Report in Map:R. Long Running Hive Query auto action not supported on HDP-3.0 +. Updates to Unravel's configuration properties v4.5.x - Updates to Unravel properties Improvements and bug fixes Improvements AutoActions Only metrics which arrive before com.unraveldata.auto.action.metric.discard.ms are discarded and not published. (AA-30) Hive-on-Spark and Hive-on-MR applications now alert in running state. (HIVE-72) Added async polling of RM in jcs2. (PLATFORM-1348) Fixed deduplication of metric stream in AA. (AA-37) Spark Made it clearer to users why Unravel does not load (BTrace) Resource Metrics until app completes. Made general improvements to Containers, VCores, Memory Graphs. Load Logs Improvements Progress is captured in the UI while Load Logs is running. Event logs are automatically loaded when not already loaded. AppBadge messages under 'Load Diagnostics' explain reason for failure to load. Made general improvements to Spark query table. Spark BTrace Sensor Improvements Split Spark SQL update from sensor into multiple messages. Added new property, com.unraveldata.spark.shutdown.delay.ms , so that last messages are processed (allows BTrace sensor to send all the data before the spark driver exits). Spark Enhancements Spark live pipeline now updates job duration and data IO while the application is running. Spark jobs and Hive query are linked for Spark-on- Hive applications. Airflow Airflow DAGs and Tasks processing are now scalable for large clusters. Added new properties to control look-back, parsing, and whether to process logs in parallel or sequentially.   Sessions Improved Session's algorithm for speeding up Spark applications. Hive   Added support for running Hive-on-MR. Added support for Hive-on-Spark. AutoAction duration metric is now published for running Hive-on-MR and Hive-on-Sparks allowing alerts while running. OnDemand  OnDemand is compatible with RHEL 7.1. Kerberos Added support for custom location for Kerberos client configuration. (CUSTOMER-774) Bug fixes Customer reported AutoActions for workflows now working per the condition specified in policy. (CUSTOMER-632) Illegal Argument errors no longer logged in unravel_tw.log . (CUSTOMER-640) Queue analysis supports queue names with quotes or special characters. (CUSTOMER-657) HBase: Connecting successfully to URL and the \"hbase.HBaseMetricsHandler: Error connecting to url\" no longer is thrown. (CUSTOMER-659) Airflow DAGs are parsed correctly. (CUSTOMER-725) Exceptions no longer cause disruptions in resource manager polling. (CUSTOMER-736) User can name Top X reports and more comprehensively specify date ranges. (CUSTOMER-737) Data Insights page is now correctly populated and displays all data. (CUSTOMER-754) All MR jobs now have correct Container, Vcores, and Memory. (CUSTOMER-764) Kafka Topic's KPIs now display cumulative value across all brokers for given time. (CUSTOMER-767, CUSTOMER-884) Impala queries are now displayed in UI and data is correctly populated\/display as user drills down (e.g., fragments). (CUSTOMER-803, CUSTOMER-860) MySQL Schema Creation (using db_schema_upgrade.sh script) no longer fails. (CUSTOMER-806) Queue analysis Reports are now generated consistently and correctly for every request. (REPORT-316, REPORT-378) Can generate reports for specific clusters. (REPORT-370) Newly added queues are polled correctly. (PLATFORM-1363) Spark Improved Spark Session's reliability; specifically in terms of short term memory usage. (SESS-189) MR and Tez UI now handles unresponsive page and Containers, vCores, Memory graphs. User is informed users when metrics are not found. (UIX-1772, UIX-1773) " },

X The access key for the corresponding ABFS storage account. - AutoActions Daemon com.unraveldata.auto.action.enable.policy.enforce.in.jcs Enables AutoActions to be processed under the legacy (pre-4.5.2.0) mode of operation when AutoAction enforcement resided in JCS2 daemon. This works for on-prem mode only. When using this mode you can stop AutoAction daemon. Unit: boolean false com.unraveldata.auto.action.max.buffered.group.count A message group represents one complete YARN metrics polling cycle. It is incomplete when it has missing messages, messages out of order, etc. This property controls how many message groups can be buffered while waiting for completion of the current group. Once the daemon has buffered the max.buffered.group.count , it either drops or accepts the incomplete group (see max.lost.messages.count ) and moves onto processing the next group. Setting this value higher than 1 may increase latency of enforcement of an Auto Actions but can help to alleviate errors in message transport protocol. Unit: count 1 com.unraveldata.auto.action.max.lost.messages.count Maximum number of lost messages a group can have and still be be accepted for aggregation and policy enforcement. Accepting incomplete groups lowers the consistency of triggered violations but lets the daemon to operate with an “unstable” connection. 0: only complete groups are accepted. > 0: groups missing up to X messages are accepted. Unit: count 0 com.unraveldata.auto.action.metric.discard.ms When a incoming metric's timestamp is older than this value it is not processed but discarded. This mechanism is designed to deal with Kafka latency, consumer lags and other message delivery delays. It prevents the daemon from acting on outdated data and issuing false-positive violation events that are irrelevant at the present time Unit: ms 3600000 (1 hour) com.unraveldata.auto.action.policy.db.update.skip.cycle Defines how often the daemon refreshes the AutoAction policy definitions when aggregating and enforcing per enforcement cycle (see enforce.period.ms ). 0: All policies are read every time the daemon's ready to aggregate and enforce policies. > 0: The policies are read every X cycle. For instance, 1: the daemon reads them every other cycle, 2: every third period and so on. Changing this value makes sense only if there are a lot of policies defined. Unit: count 0 com.unraveldata.auto.action.policy.enforce.period.ms Maximum wait period for policy enforcement to be triggered. AutoAction metric aggregation and enforcement cycle is driven by metric producers, i.e., the daemon synchronizes with the metric polling cycles for each monitored cluster. When no YARN metrics are delivered or accepted and therefore policies are not getting evaluated for longer than this period, the daemon will forcibly execute metric aggregation and policy enforcement to process other internal Unravel metrics, such as Workflow, Hive, Tez, Impala metrics. Unit: ms 180000 (3 min) com.unraveldata.auto.action.transport.receiver.ttl.ms Identifies how long a transport protocol connection remains active without receiving any data from the cluster. If no metrics are received for longer than this value, the cluster is considered terminated and connection is closed on the receiver (daemon's) side. This is important in order for Unravel to support AutoActions on transient clusters in cloud.

Other changes that occur because of this: \/srv\/unravel\/log_hdfs\/* logs are moved to \/usr\/local\/unravel\/logs \/srv\/unravel\/log_hdfs\/ directory is removed \/srv\/unravel\/tmp_hdfs\/ is no longer needed, so it is removed ( \/srv\/unravel\/tmp\/ is used instead) env vars HDFS_KEYTAB_PATH and HDFS_KERBEROS_PRINCIPAL in \/usr\/local\/unravel\/etc\/unravel.ext.sh no longer used For Kerberos, com.unraveldata.kerberos.principal and com.unraveldata.kerberos.keytab.path are used instead. After the first 4.3.x RPM upgrade, you MUST evaluate whether the \/srv\/unravel\/log_hdfs\/* logs are moved to \/usr\/local\/unravel\/logs switch_to_user.sh \/srv\/unravel\/log_hdfs\/* logs are moved to \/usr\/local\/unravel\/logs must be run in order for Unravel Server to load logs via HDFS and to access kerberos-spnego protected REST endpoints. If MapReduce or Spark jobs stop loading after upgrade, that is a strong indication that you need to switch users. This script need only be run once. See Run Unravel Daemons with Custom User for more details. Subsequent upgrades 4.3.x to 4.3.y will not need to run switch_to_user.sh script. Upgrade process An RPM upgrade will trigger a temporary background process so changes can take effect. You can monitor or wait for these with \/usr\/local\/unravel\/install_bin\/await_fixups.sh which prints \"Done\" when it finishes. The script waits and prints ps of the background process. It might take 2-5 min. depending on your data size. The background fix ups will produce log file output in: \/tmp\/unravel_post_upgrade_fixups.*.out \/tmp\/unravel_schema.*.out \/usr\/local\/unravel\/logs\/unravel_schema.log \/usr\/local\/unravel\/logs\/es_migrate_4.3.1.0_from42.* \/usr\/local\/unravel\/logs\/unravel_esm.log For further support, contact Unravel Support " },

"body" : "Tez support This release supports the monitoring of applications run within the Tez framework. This includes: Hive on Tez. Pig on Tez. Cascading on Tez. The Tez application performance manager (APM) in Unravel Web UI provides a detailed view into the behavior of \"Tez framework\" queries as a directed acyclic graph (DAG). DAG details include query text, DAG graphs, and information on vertices, tasks, and attempts. For more information, see the User Guide . Spark pipeline This release includes an improved pipeline for collecting data from Spark applications. The pipeline provides: Additional metadata. Stage level updates: Previously, the Spark APM in Unravel Web UI updated the application's page only once, when the application was finished. With this release, as soon as a stage completes, the Spark APM in Unravel Web UI shows stage level information. This improvement allows you to interact with the Spark APM more often. Smaller memory footprint. Smarter events: The event generation algorithm has been updated with additional triggers. Events are generated only if an application's original settings are significantly different from Unravel's suggested settings. Workflow tagging: Unravel Web UI now displays tagged workflows identically, irrespective of the mode in which the Spark applications were loaded. Supported loading modes remain the same: OPS mode (loading through Unravel Sensor for Spark), and BATCH mode (loaded outside of Unravel Sensor). Applications are tagged even when the event log files are unavailable. Consistent display of information about each Spark application, even if the event log file is not available. At a minimum, a Spark application's page displays the application metadata, taken from the resource manager. Multi-Cluster Kafka support This release supports data collection for multi-cluster Kafka topics, and Kafka application performance management through Unravel Web UI. Kafka support includes: Multi cluster support Multi cluster metrics monitoring. Multi cluster consumer offset\/lag monitoring. Consumer groups Single view for CG status\/stats across topics it consumes. Additional metrics added for brokers Insights Tunable sliding window algorithm. Consumer group lagging\/stalled. " },

"body" : "To deploy Unravel, first ensure that your environment meets these requirements. You must use an independent host for the Unravel server. This host must: Be managed by Cloudera. Have Hadoop clients pre-installed. Have no other Hadoop service or third-party applications installed. Accessible to only Hadoop and Unravel Admins. Platform Each version of Unravel has specific platform requirements. Confirm that your cluster meets the requirements for the version of Unravel that you're installing . Your CDH environment must be running Cloudera Manager (CM). Sizing You must have separate nodes for the Unravel server and the external MySQL database . Unravel Server Architecture: x86_64 vm.max_map_count is set to 262144 Minimum requirements for cores, RAM, and disks: The table below lists the minimum requirements for cores, RAM, and disks for a typical environment with default data retention and lookback settings . \/usr\/local\/unravel is the storage location for Unravel binaries. \/srv\/unravel is used for Elasticsearch (ES) and the bundled database. In production environments, put \/usr\/local\/unravel and \/srv\/unravel on separate disks. Putting \/srv\/unravel on a separate high spin HDD with its own SATAIII (or equivalent) bus significantly increases IO bandwidth. If \/usr\/local\/unravel or \/srv\/unravel doesn't have the minimum free space shown in the table below, create symbolic links for them to another disk. To check the space on a volume use the df command. For example, df -h \/srv Jobs per day Cores RAM \/usr\/local\/unravel \/srv\/unravel Less than 50,000 8 96 GB 8 GB free 500 GB free 50,000 to 100,000 to 8 128GB 8 GB free 500 GB free Over 100,000 Contact Unravel Support All volumes are mounted. \/tmp is mounted with executable permissions.

If you're installing Unravel version 4.5.0.0, set SELINUX to permissive or disabled in \/etc\/sysconfig\/selinux . If you're installing Unravel version 4.5.0.1+, SELINUX can be set to enabled . PATH includes the path to the HDFS+Hive+YARN+Spark client\/gateway, Hadoop commands, and Hive commands. If Spark2 service is installed, the Unravel host should be a client\/gateway. Zookeeper is not installed on the same host as the Unravel host. NTP is running and in-sync with the cluster. Permissions The installation creates a local user unravel:unravel , but you can change this later. You must have root access or \"sudo root\" permission in order to install the Unravel Server RPM. If you're using Kerberos, we'll explain how to create a principal and keytab for Unravel daemons to use to access these HDFS resources: MapReduce logs ( hdfs:\/\/user\/history ) YARN's log aggregation directory ( hdfs:\/\/tmp\/logs ) Spark and Spark2 event logs ( hdfs:\/\/user\/spark\/applicationHistory and hdfs:\/\/user\/spark\/spark2ApplicationHistory ) File and partition sizes in the Hive warehouse directory (typically hdfs:\/\/apps\/hive\/warehouse ) Unravel needs access to the YARN Resource Manager's REST API (so that the principal can determine which resource manager is active). Unravel needs access to the JDBC access to the Hive Metastore. Read-only access is sufficient. If you're using Impala, Unravel needs access to the Cloudera Manager API. Read-only access is sufficient. Network On the new node, open the following ports: Port(s) Direction Description 3000 Both Traffic to and from Unravel UI 3316 Both Database traffic 4020 Both Unravel APIs 4021 Both Host monitoring of JMX on localhost 4031 Both Database traffic 4043 In UDP and TCP ingest traffic from the entire cluster to Unravel Server(s) 4044-4049 In UDP and TCP ingest spares for unravel_lr* 4091-4099 Both Kafka brokers 4171-4174, 4176-4179 Both ElasticSearch; localhost communication between Unravel daemons or Unravel Servers in a multi-host deployment 4181-4189 Both Zookeeper daemons 4210 Both Cluster access service HDFS ports Both Traffic to\/from the cluster to Unravel Server(s) Hive metadata database port Out For YARN only.

"body" : "This topic explains how to deploy Unravel Server on Cloudera Distribution of Hadoop (CDH). Your CDH environment must be running Cloudera Manager (CM). If you have not already done so, confirm your cluster meets Unravel's hosting requirements . 1. Configure the host Use Cloudera Manager to allocate a cluster gateway\/edge\/client host with HDFS access, and create a gateway configuration for the host. The gateway configuration must have client roles for HDFS, YARN, Spark, Hive, and optionally, Spark2. 3. Install Unravel Server on the host Download the Unravel Server RPM. Ensure that the host machine's local disks have the minimum space required . Unravel Server uses two separate disks: one for binaries ( \/usr\/local\/unravel ) and one for data ( \/srv\/unravel ). The separate disk \/srv\/unravel is beneficial for performance. If either disk doesn't have the minimum space required, create symbolic links for them to another disk drive. To check the space on a volume use the df command. For example, df -h \/srv Install the Unravel Server RPM. sudo rpm -Uvh unravel- version .rpm The installation creates the following items: \/usr\/local\/unravel\/ , which contains executables, scripts, properties file ( unravel.properties ), and logs. \/etc\/init.d\/unravel_* , which contains scripts for controlling services, such as unravel_all.sh for manually stopping, starting, and getting the status of all daemons in proper order. User unravel if it doesn't exist already. 5. Configure Unravel Server with basic options (Optional) Enable additional daemons for high-volume workloads . In \/usr\/local\/unravel\/etc\/unravel.properties , set general properties for Unravel Server. Property\/Description Set by user Unit Default com.unraveldata.customer.organization Customer name. Used to identify your installation for reporting and notification purposes in Unravel UI. Optional string Not Set com.unraveldata.advertised.url Defines the Unravel Server URL for HTTP traffic. Example: http:\/\/unravelserver.company.com:3000   string http:\/\/{host}:3000 com.com.unraveldata.hdfs.timezone Timezone of HDFS, for example, US\/Eastern, Etc\/GMT-4, America\/New_York. If the timezone is not set then an error message is logged and UTC timezone is used. Possible timezones can be obtained by calling TimeZone.getAvailableIDs() . string - com.unraveldata.tmpdir The base location for Unravel process control files where Unravel's temp files reside. string (path) \/srv\/unravel\/tmp com.unraveldata.history.maxSize.weeks Number of weeks retained for search results in Elastic Search. integer 5 com.unraveldata.retention.max.days Number of days to keep the heaviest data (such as error logs and drill-down details) in the SQL Database. integer 30 Point Unravel Server to logs on HDFS. Unravel collects HDFS logs for analysis. To point Unravel Server to these logs, set the following properties in \/usr\/local\/unravel\/etc\/unravel.properties : Property\/Description Set by user Unit Default com.unraveldata.job.collector.done.log.base HDFS path to \"done\" directory of MR logs. Don't include the hdfs:\/\/ prefix For HDP set this to: \/mr-history\/done . string \/user\/history\/done com.unraveldata.job.collector.log.aggregation.base HDFS path to the aggregated container logs (logs to process). Don't include the hdfs:\/\/ prefix. The log format defaults to TFile. You can specify multiple logs and log formats (TFile or IndexedFormat). Example: TFile:\/tmp\/logs\/*\/logs\/,IndexedFormat:\/tmp\/logs\/*\/logs-ifile\/. For HDP set this to: IndexedFormat:\/app-logs\/*\/logs\/ . CSL \/tmp\/logs\/*\/logs\/ com.unraveldata.spark.eventlog.location Comma-separated list of HDFS paths to the Spark event logs. Each path must include the hdfs:\/\/\/ prefix. For HDP set this to: hdfs:\/\/\/spark1-history\/,hdfs:\/\/\/spark2-history\/ . CSL hdfs:\/\/\/user\/spark\/applicationHistory\/ For example, com.unraveldata.job.collector.done.log.base=\/user\/history\/done\ncom.unraveldata.job.collector.log.aggregation.base=\/tmp\/logs\ncom.unraveldata.spark.eventlog.location=hdfs:\/\/user\/spark\/applicationHistory,hdfs:\/\/user\/spark\/spark2 To confirm that you have the right path, use the hdfs dfs -ls command. For example, hdfs dfs -ls \/user\/history\/done\nhdfs dfs -ls \/tmp\/logs If Kerberos is enabled, create or identify a principal and keytab for Unravel daemons to use for access to HDFS and the REST API. If Sentry is enabled: Create your own alternate principal with narrow privileges and HDFS access permissions . Verify that the user running the Unravel daemon \/etc\/unravel_ctl has the permissions shown in the table below. Resource Principal Permission Purpose hdfs:\/\/user\/spark\/applicationHistory Your alt principal read+execute Spark event log hdfs:\/\/user\/spark\/spark2ApplicationHistory Your alt principal read+execute Spark2 event log (if Spark2 is installed) hdfs:\/\/user\/history Your alt principal read+execute MapReduce logs hdfs:\/\/tmp\/logs Your alt principal read+execute YARN aggregation folder hdfs:\/\/user\/hive\/warehouse Your alt principal read+execute Obtain table partition sizes with \"stat\" only 8. Start Unravel services Run the following command to start all Unravel services: sudo \/etc\/init.d\/unravel_all.sh start\nsleep 60 This completes the basic\/core configuration. 9. Log into Unravel UI Find the hostname of Unravel Server. echo \"http:\/\/$(hostname -f):3000\/\" If you're using an SSH tunnel or HTTP proxy, you might need to make adjustments. Using a supported web browser , navigate to http:\/\/ unravel-host :3000 and log in with username admin with password unraveldata . Unravel UI displays collected data . 10.

If you're running more than one version of CDH (for example, you have multiple clusters), you can add more than one parcel entry for unravel-host . Click Save . Click Check for New Parcels . On the Parcels page, pick a target cluster in the Location box. In the list of Parcel Names , find the UNRAVEL_SENSOR parcel that matches the version of the target cluster and click Download . Click Distribute . If you have an old parcel from Unravel, deactivate it now. On the new parcel, click Activate . 2. Put the Hive Hook JAR in AUX_CLASSPATH In Cloudera Manager, select the target cluster, click Hive | Configuration , and search for hive-env . In Gateway Client Environment Advanced Configuration Snippet (Safety Valve) for hive-env.sh enter the following exactly as shown, with no subsitutions: AUX_CLASSPATH=${AUX_CLASSPATH}:\/opt\/cloudera\/parcels\/UNRAVEL_SENSOR\/lib\/java\/unravel_hive_hook.jar Click YARN | Configuration , and search for hadoop-env . In Gateway Client Environment Advanced Configuration Snippet (Safety Valve) for hadoop-env.sh , enter the following exactly as shown, with no subsitutions: HADOOP_CLASSPATH=${HADOOP_CLASSPATH}:\/opt\/cloudera\/parcels\/UNRAVEL_SENSOR\/lib\/java\/unravel_hive_hook.jar If Sentry is enabled, grant privileges on the JAR files to the Sentry roles that run Hive queries. Sentry commands may also be needed to enable access to the Hive Hook JAR file. Grant privileges on the JAR files to the roles that run hive queries. Log into Beeline as user hive and use the Hive SQL GRANT statement to do so. For example (substitute role as appropriate), GRANT ALL ON URI 'file:\/\/\/opt\/cloudera\/parcels\/UNRAVEL_SENSOR\/lib\/java\/unravel_hive_hook.jar' TO ROLE role 4. Deploy the Hive Hook JAR Copy the Hive Hook snippet into hive-site.xml : From the Unravel server OS use the command cat \/usr\/local\/unravel\/hive-hook\/hive-site.xml.snip , copy the contents, and paste them into hive-site.xml . On a multi-host Unravel Server deployment, use the \/usr\/local\/unravel\/hive-hook\/hive-site.xml.snip snippet from host2. In Cloudera Manager, go to the Hive service. Select the Configuration tab. Search for hive-site.xml in the middle of the page. Add the snippet to Hive Client Advanced Configuration Snippet for hive-site.xml (Gateway Default Group). To edit, click View as XML . If you configured CDH with Cloudera Navigator's safety valve settings, your CDH hive.exec.post.hooks property has existing value(s); in which case, prepend Unravel's value into the existing values with a comma and no space, like this: <property> \n<name>hive.exec.post.hooks<\/name> \n<value>com.unraveldata.dataflow.hive.hook.HivePostHook,com.cloudera.navigator.audit.hive.HiveExecHookContext,org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.hooks.LineageLogger<\/value> \n<description>for Unravel, from unraveldata.com<\/description>\n<\/property> The Hive Client Advanced Configuration Snippet for hive-site.xml should only have the Unravel class. Add the snippet to HiveServer2 Advanced Configuration Snippet for hive-site.xml . To edit, click View as XML . Like the step above, if the CDH hive.exec.post.hooks property exists already, prepend Unravel's value to it, with a comma and no space, like this: <property>\n<name>hive.exec.post.hooks<\/name> \n<value>com.unraveldata.dataflow.hive.hook.HivePostHook,com.cloudera.navigator.audit.hive.HiveExecHookContext,org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.hooks.LineageLogger<\/value> \n<description>for Unravel, from unraveldata.com<\/description>\n<\/property> The HiveServer2 Advanced Configuration Snippet for hive-site.xml should have all 3 classes: 2 from Navigator and 1 from Unravel. Save the changes with optional comment Unravel snippet in hive-site.xml . Deploy the Hive client configuration by clicking the deploy glyph ( ) or by using the Actions pull-down menu. Restart the Hive service. Cloudera Manager recommends a restart, which is not necessary for activating these changes. Don't restart now; you can restart later. Check Unravel UI to see if all Hive queries are running. If queries are running fine and appearing in Unravel UI, you are done. If queries are failing with a class not found error or permission problems: Undo the hive-site.xml changes in Cloudera Manager. Deploy the hive client configuration. Restart the Hive service. Follow the steps in Troubleshooting . 5. Deploy the Spark JAR In Cloudera Manager, select the target cluster, then select the Spark service. Select Configuration . Search for spark-defaults . In Spark Client Advanced Configuration Snippet (Safety Valve) for spark-conf\/spark-defaults.conf , enter the following text, replacing placeholders with your particular values: spark.unravel.server.hostport= unravel-host :4043 \nspark.driver.extraJavaOptions=-javaagent:\/opt\/cloudera\/parcels\/UNRAVEL_SENSOR\/lib\/java\/btrace-agent.jar=config=driver,libs= spark-version \nspark.executor.extraJavaOptions=-javaagent:\/opt\/cloudera\/parcels\/UNRAVEL_SENSOR\/lib\/java\/btrace-agent.jar=config=executor,libs= spark-version \nspark.eventLog.enabled=true On a multi-host Unravel Server deployment, use host2's FQDN or logical hostname for unravel-host . For spark-version , use a Spark version that is compatible with this version of Unravel . For example, spark-2.0 for Spark 2.0.x spark-2.1 for Spark 2.1.x spark-2.2 for Spark 2.2.x spark-2.3 for Spark 2.3.x Save changes. Deploy the client configuration by clicking the deploy glyph ( ) or by using the Actions pull-down menu. Your spark-shell will ensure new JVM containers are created with the necessary extraJavaOptions for the Spark drivers and executors. Enable Spark streaming. The Spark streaming probe is disabled by default and you must enable it manually by editing spark-defaults.conf . Search for spark.driver.extraJavaOptions and set it to the following. Be sure to substitute the correct version of Spark for spark-version . Unravel supports the Spark streaming feature for Spark 1.6.x, 2.0.x, 2.1.x, and 2.2.x only. Support for Spark apps using the Structured Streaming API introduced in Spark 2 is limited. javaagent: unravel-sensor-path \/btrace-agent.jar=script=DriverProbe.class:SQLProbe.class:StreamingProbe.class,libs=spark- spark-version . Check Unravel UI to see if all Spark jobs are running. If jobs are running fine and appearing in Unravel UI, you're done. If queries are failing with a class not found error or permission problems: Undo the spark-defaults.conf changes in Cloudera Manager. Deploy the client configuration. Investigate and fix the issue. Follow the steps in Troubleshooting . If you have YARN-client mode applications, the default Spark configuration is not sufficient, because the driver JVM starts before the configuration set through the SparkConf is applied. For more information, see Apache Spark Configuration . In this case, configure the Unravel Sensor for Spark to profile specific Spark applications only (in other words, per-application profiling rather than cluster-wide profiling ). 6. Configure YARN-MapReduce JVM sensor cluster-wide In Cloudera Manager, go to YARN service . Select the Configuration tab. Search for Application Master Java Opts Base and concatenate the following xml block properties snippet (ensure to start with a space and add below). Make sure that \"-\" is a minus sign. You need to modify the value of unravel-host with your Unravel Server IP address or a fully qualified DNS. For multi-host Unravel installation, use the IP address of Host2. -javaagent:\/opt\/cloudera\/parcels\/UNRAVEL_SENSOR\/lib\/java\/btrace-agent.jar=libs=mr -Dunravel.server.hostport= unravel-host :4043 Search for MapReduce Client Advanced Configuration Snippet (Safety Valve) for mapred-site.xml in the middle of the page. Enter following xml four block properties snippet to Gateway Default Group . (Click View as XML .) <property>\n<name>mapreduce.task.profile<\/name>\n<value>true<\/value>\n<\/property> \n<property>\n<name>mapreduce.task.profile.maps<\/name>\n<value>0-5<\/value>\n<\/property> \n<property>\n<name>mapreduce.task.profile.reduces<\/name>\n<value>0-5<\/value>\n<\/property> \n\/\/ this is one line \n<property>\n<name>mapreduce.task.profile.params<\/name>\n<value>-javaagent:\/opt\/cloudera\/parcels\/UNRAVEL_SENSOR\/lib\/java\/btrace-agent.jar=libs=mr -Dunravel.server.hostport= unravel-host :4043<\/value><\/property> Save the changes. Deploy the client configuration by clicking the deploy glyph ( ) or by using the Actions pull-down menu. Cloudera Manager will specify a restart which is not necessary to effect these changes. (Click Restart Stale Services if that is visible. However, you can also perform this later when you have a planned maintenance.) The restart is important for MR sensor to be picked up by queries submitted via Hiveserver2. Use the Unravel UI to monitor the situation. When you view the MapReduce APM page for any completed MRjob you should see mappers and reducers in the Resource Usage tab. 7. Retrieve Impala data from Cloudera Manager Configure Unravel Server to retrieve Impala query data from Cloudera Manager as follows: Add com.unraveldata.data.source=cm in \/usr\/local\/unravel\/etc\/unravel.properties on Unravel Server. Tell Unravel Server some information about your Cloudera Manager's URL, port number, login credentials, and so on. You do this by adding the following properties to \/usr\/local\/unravel\/etc\/unravel.properties on Unravel Server: Property\/Description Set by user Unit Default com.unraveldata.cloudera.manager.url URL of Cluster Manager, for example, http:\/\/$clouderaserver In order to properly track Impala jobs, make sure that the value of this property does not contain a port number since there is already a separate config for the port. Required string - com.unraveldata.cloudera.manager.username Cloudera manager username. Required string - com.unraveldata.cloudera.manager.password Cloudera manager password. Required string - com.unraveldata.cloudera.manager.port You only need to specify this if your Cloudera Manager is not on port 7180. Required integer - For example, com.unraveldata.data.source=cm \ncom.unraveldata.cloudera.manager.url=http:\/\/ my-cm-url \ncom.unraveldata.cloudera.manager.port=9997 \ncom.unraveldata.cloudera.manager.username= mycmname \ncom.unraveldata.cloudera.manager.password= mycmpassword Make sure that the Cloudera Manager user in com.unraveldata.cloudera.manager.username has read access to Cloudera Manager REST APIs. You can verify this by running a curl command such as the following, substituting your local values for the variables: curl --user clouderamanager-username : clouderamanager-password 'http:\/\/ clouderamanager-url : clouderamanager-port \/api\/v13\/clusters'\ncurl --user clouderamanager-username : clouderamanager-password 'http:\/\/ clouderamanager-url : clouderamanager-port \/api\/v13\/clusters\/ cluster-name \/services' By default, the Impala sensor task is enabled. To disable it, specify the following option in \/usr\/local\/unravel\/etc\/unravel.properties on Unravel Server: com.unraveldata.sensor.tasks.disabled=iw (Optional) Change the Impala lookback window. By default, when Unravel Server starts, it retrieves the last 5 minutes of Impala queries. To change this, do the following: On Unravel Server, change com.unraveldata.cloudera.manager.impala.look.back.minutes in \/usr\/local\/unravel\/etc\/unravel.properties . For example, to set the lookback to 7 minutes: com.unraveldata.cloudera.manager.impala.look.back.minutes=-7 Include a minus sign in front of the new value. Restart the unravel_us daemon.

"body" : "For quick initial installation, you can use the hdfs principal and its keytab, but for production use, you might want to create an alternate principal that has restricted access to specific areas, and use its corresponding keytab. This topic explains how to do this. You can name the alternate principal whatever you prefer; these steps name it unravel . Its name doesn't need to be the same as the local username. The steps apply only to CDH and have been tested using Cloudera Manager with the recommended Sentry configuration. Check the HDFS default umask. For access via ACL, the group part of the HDFS default umask needs to have read and execute access. This allows Unravel to see subdirectories and read files. The default umask setting on HDFS for both CDH and HDP is 022 . The middle digit controls the group mask and ACLs are masked using this default group mode. You can check the HDFS umask setting from either Cloudera Manager or in hdfs-site.xml : In Cloudera Manager, check the value of dfs.umaskmode and make sure the middle digit is 2 or 0 . In hdfs-site.xml file search for fs.permissions.umask-mode and make sure the middle digit is 2 or 0 . Enable ACL inheritance. In Cloudera Manager's HDFS configuration, search for namenode advanced configuration snippet , and set its dfs.namenode.posix.acl.inheritance.enabled property to true in hdfs-site.xml . This is a workaround for an issue where HDFS was not compliant with the Posix standard for ACL inheritance. For details, see  Apache JIRA HDFS-6962 . Cloudera backported the fix for this issue into CDH5.8.4, CDH5.9.1, and later, setting dfs.namenode.posix.acl.inheritance.enabled to false in Hadoop 2.x and true in Hadoop 3.x. Restart the cluster to effect the change of dfs.namenode.posix.acl.inheritance.enabled to true . Change the ACLs of the target HDFS directories. Run the following commands as global hdfs to change the ACLs of the following HDFS directories. Run these in the order presented. Set the ACL for future directories. Be sure to set the permissions at the \/user\/history level.

In particular, the \"done\" directory might not allow decryption of logs by the hdfs principal. If you're using \"JNI\" based groups for HDFS (a setting in Cloudera Manager), you need to add this line to \/usr\/local\/unravel\/etc\/unravel.ext.sh : export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=\/opt\/cloudera\/parcels\/CDH\/lib\/hadoop\/lib\/native If Kerberos is enabled, specify the new values for keytab-file and principal in \/usr\/local\/unravel\/etc\/unravel.properties and unravel.ext.sh : Whenever you change Kerberos tokens or principal update these properties to ensure the latest Kerberos keytab file for Unravel is available on Unravel server and the restart all services, sudo \/etc\/init.d\/unravel_all.sh start .

Permissions This is a list of permissions you'll need to grant to the Unravel username after you install the Unravel Server RPM. We'll walk you through setting these up later. The only permission you need to set up right now on the Unravel host is root access or \"sudo root\" permission in order to install the Unravel Server RPM. If you're using Kerberos, you'll need to create a principal and keytab for Unravel daemons to use to access certain HDFS resources. Unravel needs access to the YARN resource manager's REST API (so that the principal can determine which resource manager is active). Unravel needs access to the JDBC access to the Hive metastore. Read-only access is sufficient. If you plan to use Unravel's move or kill auto actions, the Unravel username needs to be added to YARN's yarn.admin.acl property.

"body" : "This topic explains how to configure Unravel to retrieve additional data from Hive, Tez, Spark and Oozie, such as Hive queries, application timelines, Spark jobs, YARN resource management data, and logs. You'll do this by generating Unravel's JARs and distributing them to every node that runs queries in the cluster. Later, after JARs are distributed to the nodes, you'll integrate Hive, Tez, and Spark data with Unravel. 1. Generate and distribute Unravel's Hive Hook and Spark Sensor JARs On Unravel Server, log in as root and confirm that wget is installed. yum install -y wget Run the following commands: mkdir \/usr\/local\/unravel-jars\nchmod 775 -R \/usr\/local\/unravel-jars\/\nchown root:hadoop \/usr\/local\/unravel-jars\/ \n\nchmod +x \/usr\/local\/unravel\/install_bin\/cluster-setup-scripts\/unravel_hdp_setup.py\n\ncd \/usr\/local\/unravel\/install_bin\/cluster-setup-scripts\/\n\nsudo python2 unravel_hdp_setup.py --sensor-only --unravel-server unravel-host :3000 --spark-version spark-version --hive-version hive-version --ambari-server ambari-host \n\ncp \/usr\/local\/unravel_client\/unravel-hive- hive-version -hook.jar \/usr\/local\/unravel-jars\/\n\ncp -pr \/usr\/local\/unravel-agent\/jars\/* \/usr\/local\/unravel-jars\/\n For unravel-host , specify the protocol (http or https) and use the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) or IP address of Unravel Server. For example, https:\/\/playground3.unraveldata.com:3000 . For spark-version , use a Spark version that is compatible with this version of Unravel . For example, spark-2.0 for Spark 2.0.x spark-2.1 for Spark 2.1.x spark-2.2 for Spark 2.2.x spark-2.3 for Spark 2.3.x For hive-version , use a Hive version that is compatible with this version of Unravel . For example, 1.2.0 for Hive 1.2.0 or 1.2.1 0.13.0 for Hive 0.13.0 Files are installed locally in these two directories: \/usr\/local\/unravel_client (Hive Hook JAR) \/usr\/local\/unravel-agent\/jars\/ (Resource metrics sensor JARs) Make a note of these directories because you'll need to specify them in Ambari. Distribute \/usr\/local\/unravel_client and \/usr\/local\/unravel-agent\/jars\/ to all worker, edge, and master nodes which run queries. For example, scp -r \/usr\/local\/unravel_client\/ root@ hostname :\/usr\/local\/unravel-jars\n\nscp -r \/usr\/local\/unravel-agent\/ root@ hostname :\/usr\/local\/unravel-jars On each instrumented node, do the following: Make sure the node can reach port 4043 of Unravel Server. In Ambari, find the hive-env template , and add this line to the bottom of the file: export AUX_CLASSPATH=${AUX_CLASSPATH}:\/usr\/local\/unravel-jars\/unravel-hive-1.2.0-hook.jar \n For example, In Ambari, find the hadoop-env template , and add this line to the bottom of the file: export HADOOP_CLASSPATH=${HADOOP_CLASSPATH}:\/usr\/local\/unravel-jars\/unravel-hive-1.2.0-hook.jar For example, 2. For Oozie, copy the Hive Hook and BTrace JARs to the HDFS shared library path Copy the Hive Hook JAR, \/usr\/local\/unravel_client\/unravel-hive-1.2.0-hook.jar and the Btrace JAR, \/usr\/local\/unravel-agent\/jars\/btrace-agent.jar to the HDFS shared library path specified by oozie.libpath . If you don't do this, jobs controlled by Oozie 2.3+ will fail. If you are launching Spark actions: Copy the jar for the Spark version you are using, for example, spark-2.3. If you copy multiple Spark jars, Oozie won't be to launch actions. Ensure that the Spark event log location is configured the same as the local Spark jobs event logs' directory. In other words, Oozie must be able to locate the event log directory to store its event history logs. 4. Connect Unravel Server to Hive Completion of this step requires a restart of all affected Hive services in Ambari Web UI. In Ambari's general properties, append ,com.unraveldata.dataflow.hive.hook.UnravelHiveHook , to the following properties: Be sure to append a comma with no space followed by the property name. hive.exec.failure.hooks hive.exec.post.hooks hive.exec.pre.hooks For example, com.unraveldata.dataflow.hive.hook.UnravelHiveHook hive.exec.pre.hooks= existing-value ,com.unraveldata.dataflow.hive.hook.UnravelHiveHook\nhive.exec.post.hooks= existing-value ,com.unraveldata.dataflow.hive.hook.UnravelHiveHook\nhive.exec.failure.hooks= existing-value ,com.unraveldata.dataflow.hive.hook.UnravelHiveHook\n In Ambari's custom hive-site editor, do the following: Set hive.exec.driver.run.hooks to com.unraveldata.dataflow.hive.hook.UnravelHiveHook. If hive.exec.driver.run.hooks isn't there already, add it. Set com.unraveldata.host : to unravel-gateway-internal-IP-hostname Set com.unraveldata.hive.hook.tcp to true If you installed an Unravel version older than 4.5.1.0, set com.unraveldata.hive.hdfs.dir to \/user\/unravel\/HOOK_RESULT_DIR . For example, If LLAP is enabled, do the following: Edit hive-site.xml manually, not through Ambari Web UI. Copy the settings in Custom hive-interactive-site and paste them into \/etc\/hive\/conf\/hive-site.xml . Copy the settings in Advanced hive-interactive-env and paste them into \/etc\/hive\/conf\/hive-site.xml . If you have an Unravel version older than 4.5.1.0, create HDFS Hive Hook directories for Unravel: hdfs dfs -mkdir -p \/user\/unravel\/HOOK_RESULT_DIR\nhdfs dfs -chown unravel:hadoop \/user\/unravel\/HOOK_RESULT_DIR\nhdfs dfs -chmod -R 777 \/user\/unravel\/HOOK_RESULT_DIR 6. Connect Unravel Server to Tez If you're not running Tez, skip this step. Add these properties to \/usr\/local\/unravel\/etc\/unravel.properties : Property\/Description Set by user Unit Default com.unraveldata.yarn.timeline-service.webapp.address The http address of the Timeline service web application. Optional string (URL) - com.unraveldata.yarn.timeline-service.port Timeline service port. number 8188 Confirm that hive.execution.engine is set to tez . set hive.execution.engine=tez; Using the Ambari, configure the Btrace agent for Tez: Append the Java options below to tez.am.launch.cmd-opts and tez.task.launch.cmd-opts : -javaagent:\/usr\/local\/unravel-agent\/jars\/btrace-agent.jar=libs=mr,config=tez -Dunravel.server.hostport= unravel-host :4043 For example, Restart the affected component(s). The screenshot below illustrates this change. In a Kerberos environment you need to modify tez.am.view-acls property with the \"run as\" user or *. Confirm that Unravel UI shows Tez data. Run \/usr\/local\/unravel\/install_bin\/hive_test_simple.sh on the HDP cluster or on any cloud environment where hive.execution.engine=tez . Check Unravel UI for Tez data. Unravel UI may take a few seconds to load Tez data. In Ambari, restart all affected Hive services. 7. (Optional) Connect Unravel Server to Spark-on-YARN Completion of this step requires a restart of all affected Spark services in Ambari UI. For unravel-host , use Unravel Server's fully qualified domain name (FQDN) or IP address. For spark-version , use a Spark version that is compatible with this version of Unravel . For example, spark-2.0 for Spark 2.0.x spark-2.1 for Spark 2.1.x spark-2.2 for Spark 2.2.x spark-2.3 for Spark 2.3.x Tell Ambari where the Spark JARs are: In Ambari Web UI, on the left side, click Spark | Configs | Custom spark-defaults | Add Property and use Bulk property add mode , or edit spark-defaults.conf as follows: If your cluster only has one Spark 1.X version, spark-defaults.conf is in \/usr\/hdp\/current\/spark-client\/conf . If your cluster is running Spark 2.X, spark-defaults.conf is in \/usr\/hdp\/current\/spark2-client\/conf . The example below uses default locations for Spark JARs. Your environment may vary. spark.unravel.server.hostport= unravel-host :4043\nspark.driver.extraJavaOptions=-javaagent:\/usr\/local\/unravel-agent\/jars\/btrace-agent.jar=config=driver,libs= spark-version \nspark.executor.extraJavaOptions=-javaagent:\/usr\/local\/unravel-agent\/jars\/btrace-agent.jar=config=executor,libs= spark-version \nspark.eventLog.enabled=true Enable Spark streaming. Spark streaming is disabled by default. To enable it, edit spark-defaults.conf as follows. Search for spark.driver.extraJavaOptions and set it to the following value. Be sure to substitute the correct version of Spark for spark-version . spark.driver.extraJavaOptions=-javaagent:${ unravel-sensor-path }\/btrace-agent.jar=script=DriverProbe.class:SQLProbe.class:StreamingProbe.class,libs= spark-version The value of spark.driver.extraJavaOptions changes based on whether Spark streaming is enabled or disabled. Unravel supports the Spark streaming feature for Spark 1.6.x, 2.0.x, 2.1.x and 2.2.x only. Unravel has limited support for Spark apps using the Structured Streaming API introduced in Spark2. " },

"body" : "This topic explains how to deploy Unravel Server on the MapR converged data platform. If you have not already done so, confirm your cluster meets Unravel's hosting requirements . 1. Configure the host Allocate a cluster gateway\/edge\/client host with HDFS access. Enable the hadoop fs command, Hive, and Spark. Although Unravel Server doesn't launch Hive or Spark jobs, it's convenient to have Hive and Spark installed on this gateway\/edge\/client host. For more information about the MapR client configuration, see https:\/\/maprdocs.mapr.com\/52\/ReferenceGuide\/configure.sh.html Run the following commands this gateway\/edge\/client host as root , substituting your site-specific values for name , cldb-list , and history-server . sudo yum install mapr-client.x86_64\nsudo \/opt\/mapr\/server\/configure.sh -N name -c -C cldb-list -HS history-server \nsudo yum install mapr-hive.noarch\nsudo yum install mapr-spark.noarch Check\/add\/modify these MapR settings: Run the following commands on Unravel Server as root : sudo useradd -g mapr unravel\nhadoop fs -mkdir \/user\/unravel\nhadoop fs -chown unravel:mapr \/user\/unravel If MapR tickets are enabled, make sure you have tickets for users unravel and mapr on the target host. You might need to export ticket environment variables (such as MAPR_TICKETFILE_LOCATION ) in \/srv\/unravel\/unravel_ctl first. Check\/adjust available RAM on the Unravel gateway\/client host: free -g For instructions on adjusting RAM allocated to MapR-FS (mfs), see https:\/\/community.mapr.com\/docs\/DOC-1209 . For example, edit \/opt\/mapr\/conf\/warden.conf as follows: service.command.mfs.heapsize.maxpercent=10 Restart MapR-FS (mfs). 3. Install Unravel Server on the host Download the Unravel Server RPM. Ensure that the host machine's local disks have the minimum space required . Unravel Server uses two separate disks: one for binaries ( \/usr\/local\/unravel ) and one for data ( \/srv\/unravel ). The separate disk \/srv\/unravel is beneficial for performance. If either disk doesn't have the minimum space required, create symbolic links for them to another disk drive. To check the space on a volume use the df command. For example, df -h \/srv Install the Unravel Server RPM. sudo rpm -Uvh unravel- version .rpm The installation creates the following items: \/usr\/local\/unravel\/ , which contains executables, scripts, properties file ( unravel.properties ), and logs. \/etc\/init.d\/unravel_* , which contains scripts for controlling services, such as unravel_all.sh for manually stopping, starting, and getting the status of all daemons in proper order. User unravel if it doesn't exist already. 5. Modify Unravel Server for MapR Run the following commands on Unravel Server. sudo \/etc\/init.d\/unravel_all.sh stop\nsudo \/usr\/local\/unravel\/install_bin\/switch_to_mapr.sh This change is persistent; you don't have to do this when you upgrade the RPM. 6. Configure Unravel Server with basic options (Optional) Enable additional daemons for high-volume workloads . In \/usr\/local\/unravel\/etc\/unravel.properties , set general properties for Unravel Server. Property\/Description Set by user Unit Default com.unraveldata.customer.organization Customer name. Used to identify your installation for reporting and notification purposes in Unravel UI. Optional string Not Set com.unraveldata.advertised.url Defines the Unravel Server URL for HTTP traffic. Example: http:\/\/unravelserver.company.com:3000   string http:\/\/{host}:3000 com.com.unraveldata.hdfs.timezone Timezone of HDFS, for example, US\/Eastern, Etc\/GMT-4, America\/New_York. If the timezone is not set then an error message is logged and UTC timezone is used. Possible timezones can be obtained by calling TimeZone.getAvailableIDs() . string - com.unraveldata.tmpdir The base location for Unravel process control files where Unravel's temp files reside. string (path) \/srv\/unravel\/tmp com.unraveldata.history.maxSize.weeks Number of weeks retained for search results in Elastic Search. integer 5 com.unraveldata.retention.max.days Number of days to keep the heaviest data (such as error logs and drill-down details) in the SQL Database. integer 30 Point Unravel Server to logs on HDFS. Unravel collects HDFS logs for analysis. To point Unravel Server to these logs, set the following properties in \/usr\/local\/unravel\/etc\/unravel.properties : Property\/Description Set by user Unit Default com.unraveldata.job.collector.done.log.base HDFS path to \"done\" directory of MR logs. Don't include the hdfs:\/\/ prefix For HDP set this to: \/mr-history\/done . string \/user\/history\/done com.unraveldata.job.collector.log.aggregation.base HDFS path to the aggregated container logs (logs to process). Don't include the hdfs:\/\/ prefix. The log format defaults to TFile. You can specify multiple logs and log formats (TFile or IndexedFormat). Example: TFile:\/tmp\/logs\/*\/logs\/,IndexedFormat:\/tmp\/logs\/*\/logs-ifile\/. For HDP set this to: IndexedFormat:\/app-logs\/*\/logs\/ . CSL \/tmp\/logs\/*\/logs\/ com.unraveldata.spark.eventlog.location Comma-separated list of HDFS paths to the Spark event logs. Each path must include the hdfs:\/\/\/ prefix. For HDP set this to: hdfs:\/\/\/spark1-history\/,hdfs:\/\/\/spark2-history\/ . CSL hdfs:\/\/\/user\/spark\/applicationHistory\/ If the Application Timeline Server (ATS) requires user authentication, set the following properties: Property\/Description Set by user Unit Default yarn.ats.webapp.username Username required for authentication to the Application Timeline Server (if authentication is required). Optional string - yarn.ats.webapp.password Password required for authentication to the Application Timeline Server (if authentication is required). Optional string - Connect to the Oozie server by setting oozie.server.url . Enable https access to Resource Manager by setting https.protocol . Define the monitoring frequency. Property\/Description Set by user Unit Default com.unraveldata.s3.batch.monitoring.interval.sec Defines the monitoring frequency. Set this property to 60 for lower latency. s 180 If Kerberos is enabled, add authentication for HDFS: Create or identify a principal and keytab for Unravel daemons to access HDFS and REST when Kerberos is enabled. Find and verify the principal keytab by running this command: klist -kt KEYTAB_FILE Set the Linux file permissions of the keytab file to 500 ( chmod 500 ) and set its owner set to unravel or to your chosen user, as explained in Run Unravel Daemons with Custom User . In \/usr\/local\/unravel\/etc\/unravel.properties , add\/set these properties for Kerberos: com.unraveldata.kerberos.principal=unravel\/ my-host . my-domain @ my-realm \ncom.unraveldata.kerberos.keytab.path=\/usr\/local\/unravel\/etc\/unravel.keytab If Sentry is enabled, add these permissions: Define your own alt principal with narrow privileges and the access permissions shown in the table below. The alt principal can be unravel (default) or one of your choosing. The corresponding kerberos principal does not need to be the same as the local user. Verify that the user running the Unravel daemon \/etc\/unravel_ctl has the access permissions shown in the table below. Resource Principal Access Purpose hdfs:\/\/user\/spark\/applicationHistory mapr or alternate read+execute Spark event log hdfs:\/\/usr\/history\/done mapr or alternate read+execute MapReduce logs hdfs:\/\/tmp\/logs mapr or alternate read+execute YARN aggregation folder hdfs:\/\/user\/hive\/warehouse mapr or alternate read+execute Obtain table partition sizes Hive Metastore access hive read+execute Hive table information 9. Start Unravel services Run the following command to start all Unravel services: sudo \/etc\/init.d\/unravel_all.sh start\nsleep 60 This completes the basic\/core configuration. 10. Log into Unravel UI Find the hostname of Unravel Server. echo \"http:\/\/$(hostname -f):3000\/\" If you're using an SSH tunnel or HTTP proxy, you might need to make adjustments. Using a supported web browser , navigate to http:\/\/ unravel-host :3000 and log in with username admin with password unraveldata . Unravel UI displays collected data . 11.

The copies are is named *.preunravel . For example, \/opt\/mapr\/hive\/hive-1.2\/conf\/hive-site.xml.preunravel . Once the files are present on the Unravel host, you can compress them with the tar command and distribute them to other hosts, if that is more convenient than running the script. All instrumented nodes must be able to open port 4043 of Unravel Server (host2 if multi-host Unravel install). 2. For Oozie, copy Unravel Hive Hook and BTrace JARs to the HDFS shared library path Copy the Hive Hook JAR in \/usr\/local\/unravel_client\/ and the metrics JARs in \/usr\/local\/unravel-agent\/ to the shared lib path specified by oozie.libpath . If you don't do this, jobs controlled by Oozie 2.3+ will fail. 3. Confirm that Unravel Web UI shows additional data Run a Hive job using a test script provided by Unravel Server. This is where you can see the effects of the instrumentation setup. Best practice is to run this test script on Unravel Server rather than on a gateway\/edge\/client node. That way you can verify that instrumentation is working first, and then enable instrumentation on other gateway\/edge\/client nodes. username must be a user that can create tables in the default database. If you need to use a different database, copy the script and edit it to change the target database. This script creates a uniquely named table in the default database, adds some data, runs a Hive query on it, and then deletes the table. It runs the query twice using different workflow tags so you can clearly see the two different runs of the same workflow in Unravel UI. sudo -u username \/usr\/local\/unravel\/install_bin\/hive_test_simple.sh 4. Confirm and adjust the settings in yarn-site.xml Check specific properties in \/opt\/mapr\/hadoop\/hadoop-2.7.0\/etc\/hadoop\/yarn-site.xml to be sure that these settings are present: yarn.resourcemanager.webapp.address <property> \n<name>yarn.resourcemanager.webapp.address<\/name> \n<value> your-resource-manager-webapp-ip-address :8088<\/value>\n<source>yarn-site.xml<\/source>\n<\/property> yarn.log-aggregation-enable <property>\n<name>yarn.log-aggregation-enable<\/name> \n<value>true<\/value>\n<description>For log aggregations<\/description>\n<\/property> 5. Enable additional instrumentation on other hosts in the cluster Run the shell script unravel_mapr_setup.sh on each node of the cluster, just like you ran it on Unravel Server, above. Copy the newly edited yarn-site.xml , to all nodes. Do a rolling restart of HiveServer2. To instrument more servers, you can use the setup script we provide or see the effect it has and replicate that effect using your own automated provisioning system. If you already have a way to customize and deploy hive-site.xml , yarn-site.xml , and user defined function JARs, you can add the changes and JAR from Unravel to your existing mechanism. 6. Enable instrumentation manually Enable instrumentation manually by updating hive-site.xml , hive-env.sh , spark-defaults.conf , hadoop-env.sh , mapred-site.xml , and tez-site.xml , as explained below. Once the files are updated on the Unravel host, you can use the scp command to copy them to other hosts. Back up your original files in case you need to roll back changes. In all cases, instrumented nodes must be able to open port 4043 of Unravel Server (host2 if multi-host Unravel install). Update hive-site.xml .

You need an AWS account. You must be able to connect to AWS for the deployment process. Create an S3 ReadAccess only IAM role and assign it to Unravel Server to READ the archive logs on the S3 bucket configured for the EMR cluster. In other words, create an IAM role that contains the policy that can only READ the specific S3 bucket used on the EMR cluster; then, create an EC2 instance profile and add the IAM role to it. AWS Permissions and Access: You must have permission to: Create EC2 instances Connect to EC2 instances Install software on EC2 instances (you must have root access or \"sudo root\" permission in order to install the Unravel Server RPM) Create security groups and IAM roles Update IAM roles for the EMR cluster and the corresponding S3 storage If you want to deploy Unravel for a new EMR cluster, you also need AWS permissions to create an EMR cluster and necessary S3 buckets, create and configure VPCs, etc. Network The following ports must be open on the Unravel EC2 instance. In addition, the Unravel EC2 instance must be able to access all ports on the EMR cluster. Settings related to IAM roles and security groups In order to manage, monitor, and optimize the modern data applications running on your EMR cluster, Unravel needs data from the cluster as well as from apps running on the cluster. This data includes metrics, configuration information, and logs. Parts of this data is pushed to Unravel, and part of it is pulled by the daemons running on Unravel Server. In order for all data to be accessible, there must be both inbound and outbound access between Unravel Server (on the EC2 instance) and the EMR cluster. The Unravel Server must be in the same region as the target EMR cluster(s) it will be monitoring. There are two possible scenarios: Both the EMR cluster and the Unravel Server are created on the same VPC, same subnet; and the security group allows all traffic from the same subnet. The EMR cluster is located on a different VPC than Unravel Server. In this case you must configure VPC peering, route table creation, and update the security policy . The Unravel Server needs a TCP and UDP connection to the EMR master node. To implement this, do either of the following: Create a security group that allows port 3000 and port 4043 from the EMR cluster node's IP address. Configure the security group on Unravel Server to allow TCP traffic on ports 3000 for EMR cluster nodes. Put the member of security group used on the EMR cluster in this rule. The Unravel Server and EMR cluster(s) must allow all outbound traffic. EMR cluster nodes must allow all traffic from Unravel Server. If you can't allow Unravel Server to access all traffic, you must minimally allow Unravel Server to access cluster nodes' TCP port 8020, 50010, and 50020. Port(s) Direction Description 3000 Both Non- HTTPS traffic to and from Unravel UI 4043 In UDP and TCP ingest traffic from the entire cluster to Unravel Server(s) Skill set These instructions assume you're proficient in: Provisioning EC2 instances and RDS instances Creating and configuring the required IAM roles, security groups, and so on Understanding AWS networking concepts such as virtual private clouds (VPCs), subnets, and so on Running Ansible scripts, basic Unix commands, and AWS CLI commands You don't need to create any scripts or be familiar with any specific programming\/scripting language.

If you have not already done so, confirm your cluster meets Unravel's hosting requirements . 1. Create an EC2 instance On your AWS console ( https:\/\/console.aws.amazon.com\/ ), go to the EC2 dashboard and click Launch Instance . Select the following options based on Unravel's instance requirements : Base OS Instance type and size EC2 instance's security group \/ IAM role Best practice is to create an IAM role that contains the policy that only reads the specific S3 bucket used on EMR cluster, and then create and instance profile and add the IAM role to it. Ports Networking The EC2 instance must be in same region with the target EMR clusters which Unravel EC2 node will be monitoring. Security groups or policies Create an S3 ReadAccess only IAM role and assign it to Unravel EC2 node to read the archive logs on the S3 bucket configured for the EMR cluster. Create TCP and UDP connections from the EMR master node to Unravel EC2 node. Create a security group that allows port 3000 and port 4043 from EMR cluster nodes' IP address, and put the member of the security group used on EMR cluster in this rule. Sample inbound rule Type Protocol Port range Source All traffic All All Security group ID of this group or subnet IP block. For example, 10.10.0.0\/16 SSH TCP 22 0.0.0.0\/0 or trusted public IP for SSH access Custom TCP Rule TCP 3000 Security group ID used on the EMR cluster or subnet IP block (if IP block belongs to a different VPC).

Required for VPC peering connection. Sample outbound rule Type Protocol Port range Source All traffic All All 0.0.0.0\/0 The Unravel EC2 node should have all TCP access to the EMR cluster (server\/parent or worker) nodes. You can grant access by inserting a security policy into both security groups of the EMR server\/parent and worker with all TCP, all port range. The source is the security group ID of the Unravel VM. For an example, see the screenshot below. If it isn't possible to allow the Unravel EC2 access to all traffic to EMR cluster, you must minimally allow it to access cluster nodes' TCP ports 8020, 50010 and 50020. 2.

"body" : "This topic explains how to set up and configure your EMR cluster so that Unravel can begin monitoring jobs running on the cluster. Assumptions The EC2 instance for Unravel Server has been created. Unravel services are running. The security group on the Unravel EC2 instance allows traffic to\/from EMR cluster nodes on TCP port 3000. The Unravel EC2 instance and EMR clustersallow all outbound traffic. The nodes in the EMR cluster allow all traffic from the Unravel EC2 instance. This implies either of the following configurations: The EMR cluster and Unravel EC2 instance are on the same VPC and same subnet, and their security group allows all traffic from the same subnet. The EMR cluster is on a different VPC, and you've configured VPC peering, route table creation, and updated your security policy . Network ACL on VPC allows all traffic. Connect to a new EMR cluster Follow the steps below to run Unravel's bootstrap script, unravel_emr_bootstrap.py , on all nodes in the cluster. The bootstrap script makes the following changes: On the master node: On Hive clusters, it updates \/etc\/hive\/conf\/hive-site.xml . On Spark clusters, it updates \/etc\/spark\/conf\/spark-defaults.conf . It updates \/etc\/hadoop\/conf\/mapred-site.xml . It updates \/etc\/hadoop\/conf\/yarn-site.xml . If Tez is installed, it updates \/etc\/tez\/conf\/tez-site.xml . It installs and starts the unravel_es daemon in \/usr\/local\/unravel_es . It installs the Spark and MapReduce sensors in \/usr\/local\/unravel-agent . It installs the Hive Hook sensor in \/usr\/lib\/hive\/lib\/ . On all other nodes: It installs the Spark and MapReduce sensors in \/usr\/local\/unravel-agent . It installs Hive sensors in \/usr\/lib\/hive\/lib . Download Unravel's bootstrap script, unravel_emr_bootstrap.py . curl https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/unraveldatarepo\/unravel_emr_bootstrap.py -o \/tmp\/unravel_emr_bootstrap.py Upload the bootstrap script to an S3 bucket. Permissions needed You need write access to the S3 bucket that you want to upload the bootstrap script to. In addition, the AWS account you use to create the EMR cluster must have read access to the bootstrap script in order to execute its directives. To upload the bootstrap script to the default EMR logging bucket, s3:\/\/aws-logs- account_number - region \/elasticmapreduce , execute the following command: aws s3 cp unravel_emr_bootstrap.py s3:\/\/aws-logs- account_number - region \/elasticmapreduce In the AWS console, select the EMR service and click Create cluster . In the Create Cluster - Quick Options screen, click Go to advanced options . In Release , select emr-5.14.0 , and select all the apps you need. For transient EMR clusters, add a step to run the Unravel JAR s3:\/\/unraveldatarepo\/unravel-bootstrap-step.jar . During cluster creation, this JAR waits for the unravel_es daemon to be up and running. It logs its actions in \/tmp\/unravel\/unravel_step.log on the master node. In the Add steps (optional) section, select step type Custom JAR , and click Configure . The Add step dialog appears. In JAR location , enter s3:\/\/unraveldatarepo\/unravel-bootstrap-step.jar In Arguments , enter these two parameters: Parameter 1: Maximum number of minutes for which the step will wait for unravel_es to come up.  Default: 4. Parameter 2: Length of each interval in seconds after which the step will check for the status of unravel_es . Default: 2. Click Add . Click Next . In Step 2: Hardware , specify the following settings: Set Network and EC2 Subnet to the cluster's VPC and subnet. The security group of the subnet you specify must have access to the Unravel EC2 node. If you created the Unravel EC2 node from our CloudFormation template, then a new VPC was generated, named Unravel_VPC. This VPC comes with one configured subnet, and by default has a CIDR \/ network address block of 10.10.0.0\/16 (but you might have changed this during stack creation). If you created the Unravel EC2 node from our Amazon Machine Image (AMI), you must create the EMR cluster on the same VPC and same subnet as the Unravel EC2 node. Modify the instance type and enter the desired instance count for core (worker) nodes. Click Next . In Step 3: General Cluster Settings , specify the following settings: For more guidance on creating a new EMR cluster, see Amazon documentation . Cluster name : Enter the name of your cluster. S3 bucket : Specify the location for your log files. In Add bootstrap action , select Custom action . In the Add Bootstrap Action dialog, specify the following settings: If you create multiple bootstrap actions, make sure you specify that Unravel's bootstrap action runs last, after all other bootstrap actions have completed. Setting Values Name Custom action Script location Enter the S3 bucket that you uploaded Unravel's bootstrap script to . For example, s3:\/\/aws-logs- account_number - region \/elasticmapreduce Optional arguments You must specify these settings: --unravel-server : IP address of the Unravel EC2 instance --bootstrap : Indicates that this action must be run at cluster creation time For example, --unravel-server unravel-ec2-ip-address --bootstrap You can also specify these settings: --metrics-factor interval : Specifies the interval at which Unravel sensors push data from the EMR cluster nodes to Unravel Server. interval is in units of 5 seconds. In other words, a value of 1 means 5 seconds, 2 means 10 seconds, and so on. Default: 1 --all : Enables all sensors, including the MapReduce sensor. --disable-aa : Disables the auto action feature. --enable-am-polling : Enables \"application master\" metrics polling for auto actions. --hive-id-cache num-jobs : Maximum number of jobs you expect to have on the cluster. Default: 1000. --init : Change the initial wait time when running in bootstrap mode. Default: 300. --sensor-url : Download sensor and daemon files from external URL. (Note: The sensor is uploaded to cluster dfs \/tmp\/unravel-sensors\/ the first time being installed. This can be configured with --sensor-dfs-path parameter.) If your cluster is kerberized, the default security settings should work, but you can change them . Click Add . Click Configure and add . Select Step 4: Security and edit the hardware configuration for the cluster as follows: Choose the EC2 key pair . Select the EC2 security groups . AWS EMR service automatically applies additional rules that are required for EMR nodes. In this example, the security group picked for both Master and Core & Task nodes have rules allowing all traffic access from the Unravel EC2 node. You must choose the security group that includes the Unravel EC2 instance, otherwise bootstrapping will fail. Click Create cluster . If everything was entered correctly, your new EMR cluster should finish the bootstrap process and be in the Waiting state. Once your new EMR cluster is up and running, you can run some jobs and log into the Unravel EC2 node's web UI to see the metrics collected by the Unravel node. Connect to an existing EMR cluster To connect the Unravel EC2 instance to an existing EMR cluster, follow the steps below to run the Unravel EMR Ansible playbook either on the EMR master node or on your Mac\/Linux workstation. The following process is for existing clusters created without Unravel bootstrap. At this time, only those clusters of this type that do not have auto-scaling enabled are supported. Whenever you upgrade Unravel Server, repeat the steps below to upgrade Unravel Sensors as well.

You can leave all other settings with default values or specify values suitable to your requirements. Network & Security Settings Virtual Private Cloud : Select the VPC that contains minimally two subsets and on the same region that you plan to deploy Unravel and the EMR cluster. Subnet group : Select the new database subnet group you created , named unravel . Public accessibility : No Availability zone : No Preference VPC security group : Select the new VPC security group you created . Click Create database . You should see the following message. 3. Connect Unravel to the RDS instance By default, the security group created for the unravel RDS has no network access granted on port 3306 on the subnet connected. You must modify the security group applied on Unravel RDS. In the Amazon RDS dashboard, locate the MySQL database endpoint. Look for the security group used for the Unravel RDS instance. Modify the inbound rule of the security group by adding a new rule to allow connections from either: The Unravel EC2 instance's security group. The subnet IP block in which the Unravel EC2 instance located. Either the security group or IP block works, provided the RDS instance is located on the same region as the VPC. On Unravel Server, verify the MySQL connection. For example, \/usr\/local\/unravel\/mysql\/bin\/mysql -h unravelmysqlprod.csfw1hkmlpgh.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com -u unravel -p Verify that the database unravel_mysql_prod has been created; if not create it. CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS unravel_mysql_prod; 4. Create a schema for the RDS instance Stop Unravel Server. sudo \/etc\/init.d\/unravel_all.sh stop Set or add the following properties in \/usr\/local\/unravel\/etc\/unravel.properties so that Unravel Server knows about the database. If the property isn't found, add it. Use the actual values you set in the steps above. You can use a hostname; but to avoid DNS lookups use an IP address. The database password can be encrypted . These properties define the connection to Unravel's MySQL database. Property\/Description Set by user Unit Default unravel.jdbc.username Unravel database user. Required string - unravel.jdbc.password Password for unravel.jdbc.username . Required string - unravel.jdbc.url URL for jdbc, determined by your database. Example: jdbc:mysql:\/\/127.0.0.1:3306\/unravel_mysql_prod Required string (path) - unravel.jdbc.username=unravel\nunravel.jdbc.password= unraveldata \nunravel.jdbc.url=jdbc:mysql:\/\/unravelmysqlprod.csfw1hkmlpgh.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com:3306\/unravel_mysql_prod Ensure the schema is up to date using the schema upgrade utility provided by Unravel Server. The script step connects to the database and applies schema deltas, in order, until the schema is up to date. The success or failure of the update is noted. sudo \/usr\/local\/unravel\/dbin\/db_schema_upgrade.sh If table creation privilege is not granted because an internal DBA support group provides the external database, request that they apply the schemas in \/usr\/local\/unravel\/sql\/mysql\/ in numerical order. The schema deltas assume the database name is already picked with a 'use' statement. The schema_migrations table keeps track of what schemas have been applied. Create the default user admin with the SQL statement emitted by \/usr\/local\/unravel\/install_bin\/db_initial_inserts.sh | \/usr\/local\/unravel\/install_bin\/db_access.sh 5. Start Unravel Server Disable the bundled database on Unravel Server. Only one of these commands is needed, depending on your exact version of Unravel.

"body" : "Follow these steps only if you have an Amazon EMR cluster located in a different VPC than the Unravel EC2 instance. This topic explains how to resolve connectivity issues when you have an Amazon EMR cluster located in a different VPC than your Unravel EC2 instance or your Unravel EC2 instance connects to an RDS instance created on a different VPC in the same region. Assumptions The VPC where Unravel EC2 located is in the same region as the EMR cluster. The subnet used by Unravel EC2 does not overlap the IP block range of the subnet used in the EMR cluster. Network ACLs on both the VPC for Unravel EC2 and the EMR cluster are the default and allow all traffic. The security group is the only security enforcement on network access. The examples below show both the Unravel EC2 instance and the EMR cluster in the us-east-1 region but configured with different VPC and subnet. There is no network access allowed between Unravel EC2 and EMR cluster by default.

Create VPC peering in VPC dashboard From the AWS console | VPC services | Peering Connections , click Create Peering Connection . Enter the name tag. For example, EMR_to_Unravel . In the VPC (Requester) field, select the VPC of the EMR cluster. In the VPC (Accepter) field, select the VPC of Unravel Server. Click Create Peering Connection . A success message should appear in the screen. Click OK . 2. Accept the VPC peering request In the VPC Dashboard , the new VPC peering connection has the status Pending Acceptance . Select this connection, click Action , and select Accept Request . Click Yes Accept in the prompt screen. You will see a message regarding \"Modify my route tables\". Click Close . 3. Create routes between peered VPC To create the routes between peered VPCs (Unravel Server on Unravel_VPC and the EMR cluster on Test_EMR_VPC): Go to VPC Dashboard | Route Tables . After locating each route table, click Edit | Add another route . Find the Unravel_VPC route table. In the Destination field, enter the IP block of the EMR VPC. For example, 10.11.0.0\/16 In the Target field , select the VPC peer connection ID. For example, pcx-0a57a978ef9a525e2 . Click Save . Find the Test_EMR_VPC route table. Set the Destination to the IP block of Unravel_VPC. For example, 10.10.0.0\/16 . In the Target field, select the VPC peer connection ID. For example, pcx-0a57a978ef9a525e2 . Click Save . In the Target field, select the connection ID. For example, pcx-0a57a978ef9a525e2 . Click Save . 4. Update security groups Go to VPC Dashboard | Security Group . After locating each security group: Click Add another rule . Set Type to inbound ALL traffic and Protocol to ALL . Locate the security group used on Unravel EC2 node. Enter the EMR VPC IP block in the Source field. For example, 10.11.0.0\/16 . Click Save . Locate the security group used on EMR cluster node and enter the Unravel VPC IP block. For example, 10.10.0.0\/16 . Click Save . 5. Verify the connection between Unravel and the EMR master node Open SSH sessions to both Unravel EC2 nodeand EMR master node. Since the above example allows all traffic from both VPC IP blocks, you should be able to ping the IP address of EMR master node from Unravel Server. On the Unravel EC2 instance, open a telnet session to the EMR master node port 8082 (the namenode port). On the EMR master node, open telnet sessions to the Unravel EC2 instnace, ports 3000 and 4043. If telnet port tests are positive, the VPC peering connection is setup correctly. If not, troubleshoot the configuration on network ACL, security groups, and route tables used on both VPCs . " },

The Unravel EC2 instance must be in the same region as the target EMR clusters it's monitoring. So, no region recovery is needed. Unravel is designed to maintain business continuity but doesn't support high availability (HA). Routine maintenance There are multiple means by which Unravel announces and documents details of availability of new versions: In the . Unravel Solution Engineers and Account Management Team members engage with customers directly to tell them about the availability of upgrades and patches Blogs published on the Unravel website Through the Unravel Newsletter (sign up on the Unravel website ) Emergency maintenance In the event of fault conditions, such as a transient failure of an AWS Service such that the availability of EC2 in a particular availability zone (AZ) is degraded, or a more permanent failure of an AWS service such that EC2 instance has faulted, or an EC2 Scheduled Maintenance Event is received, the best course of action to take in such situations is to have already made a backup of the system.

The steps below assume that: You have an Azure account. You already have a resource group assigned to a region in order to group your policies, VMs, and storage blobs\/lakes\/drives. A resource group is a container that holds related resources for an Azure solution. In Azure, you logically group related resources such as storage accounts, virtual networks, and virtual machines (VMs) to deploy, manage, and maintain them as a single entity. You already have a virtual network for your resource group. This virtual network will be shared by your cluster and the Unravel VM. Log into the Azure portal . Click Storage accounts | + Add . On the Basics tab, enter values for the following fields: Subscription : Select the subscription type. Resource Group : Select the resource group to associate with this storage instance. Storage Account Name : Enter a name, using lowercase letters and numbers. Location : Select a data center region. Performance : Select Standard or Premium : Standard storage uses magnetic disks and is cheaper. Premium storage uses SSDs, so it has higher performance and is recommended for Spark and Kafka clusters. Account kind : Select your storage format. Replication : Select your desired replication to either be local, or always available in the same zone, region, or replicated geographically. See more choices in the Advanced section. Locally redundant storage (LRS) : Only handles failures within the data-center. Durability guarantee is 11 9's.

This topic explains how to create a separate Azure VM, install the Unravel RPM, and configure it. If you have not already done so, confirm your cluster meets Unravel's hosting requirements . 1. Provision an Azure VM for Unravel Server Log into the Azure portal . Select Virtual machines , and click + Add . On the Basics tab, enter values for the following fields: Subscription : Select the subscription type. Resource Group : Select the resource group to associate with this VM. The VM inherits configurations for lifecycle, permissions, and policies from this group. Virtual machine name : Enter a name, using only alphanumeric characters, hypens (\"-\"), and underscores (\"_\"). The VM name you specify here also becomes the VM's hostname. Region : Select a data center region for this VM. Some VM types are unavailable in some regions. Availability options : Select your redundancy (durability) settings. Image : Select a compatible underlying operating system for the VM. Size (required): Select a VM type that meets Unravel's requirements . Select your VM's Authentication type . Best practice is to authenticate using an SSH public key, which you can generate using ssh-keygen . Avoid any reserved names like \"admin\" for the username. Set Inbound Port Rules: If you plan to allow external access to Unravel UI, select Allow selected ports and then select HTTPS and SSH . Click Next: Disks . On the Disks tab, enter values for the following fields: OS disk type : For better performance in production, we recommend a Premium SSD because it tolerates higher IOPS. For a dev\/test cluster, we suggest a Standard SSD . Advanced : We recommend using managed disks that have better performance and reliability. Data disks : If you don't have a disk ready, click Create and attach new disk . In the dialog box, specify the disk name, size in GiB (must meet Unravel's minimum requirements ), and source type of \"empty disk\". Otherwise, click Attach an existing disk . Click Next: Networking . On the Networking tab, enter values for the following fields: For HDInsight, it's essential that the VM, the Azure storage, and the cluster(s) you plan to monitor are all on the same virtual network and subnet(s). Virtual network (required): Select the appropriate virtual network for your cluster(s). Subnet (required): Select a subnet with the appropriate address range based on the number of IPs you plan to have in your network . NIC network security group: Set this to Basic . For HDInsight, a TCP and UDP connection is needed from the \" head node \" of each HDInsight cluster to Unravel Server. Add an inbound security policy to allow SSH access and 443 access to the Unravel node. The default security policy should allow all access within the VNET. Default rules start with a priority of 65000. Click Review + create . Click Create . It takes about 2 minutes to create your VM. When Azure completes the creation of your VM, click Go to resource . Copy the VM's public IP address. Open an SSH session to your VM's public IP address to verify that your IP address is reachable: ssh -i ssh-key user @ ip-address Verify that eth0 on the new VM is bound to the private IP address shown in the Azure portal. ifconfig\neth0 Link encap:Ethernet HWaddr 00:0d:3a:1b:c2:48\n inet addr:10.10.1.96 2.

Prerequisites Unravel Server must already be running, with the Unravel UI accessible on port 3000 . If you plan to create a cluster, you must have the following information ready: Virtual Network and subnet of the Unravel VM Your Azure Storage details. For storage setup, see Create Azure Storage . Read the latest documentation on the ports required by HDInsight: https:\/\/docs.microsoft.com\/en-us\/azure\/hdinsight\/hdinsight-hadoop-port-settings-for-services Ensure Unravel service is running on Unravel VM and ports 3000 and 4043 are reachable from the Azure HDInsight cluster master node before running the the Unravel \"script action\" script. Run the following checks: ssh -i ssh_key ssh_user @ unravel-host \nsudo su -\nnetstat -anp | grep 3000\ntcp 0 0 0.0.0.0:3000 0.0.0.0:* LISTEN 65072\/node\nhostname\n\n# On one of the cluster's head nodes:\nping unravel-host Troubleshooting tips From the Azure portal, you can check if a script action finished successfully by checking the Script Action History : If script action process fails, you can check the error messages from the HDInsight cluster's Ambari dashboard, which has a balloon next to the cluster name on the top menu bar with the recent operations. Click Ops and search for the most recent run_customscriptaction command and inspect the log messages. You may see multiple entries of run_customscriptaction which were created by previous runs. The Unravel script action cannot be rerun. If you need to redeploy the Unravel script action, you must submit a new \"script action\" script with a different name. " },

"body" : "This topic explains how to install Unravel on an Azure VM with required network setup to connect the Unravel VM to your Azure Databricks workspaces. If you have not already done so, confirm your new node meets Unravel's hosting requirements . 1. Provision an Azure VM for Unravel Server Log into the Azure portal . Select Virtual machines , and click + Add . On the Basics tab, enter values for the following fields: Subscription : Select the subscription type. Resource Group : Select the resource group to associate with this VM. The VM inherits configurations for lifecycle, permissions, and policies from this group. Virtual machine name : Enter a name, using only alphanumeric characters, hypens (\"-\"), and underscores (\"_\"). The VM name you specify here also becomes the VM's hostname. Region : Select a data center region for this VM. Some VM types are unavailable in some regions. Availability options : Select your redundancy (durability) settings. Image : Select a compatible underlying operating system for the VM. Size (required): Select a VM type that meets Unravel's requirements . Select your VM's Authentication type . Best practice is to authenticate using an SSH public key, which you can generate using ssh-keygen . Avoid any reserved names like \"admin\" for the username. Set Inbound Port Rules: If you plan to allow external access to Unravel UI, select Allow selected ports and then select HTTPS and SSH . Click Next: Disks . On the Disks tab, enter values for the following fields: OS disk type : For better performance in production, we recommend a Premium SSD because it tolerates higher IOPS. For a dev\/test cluster, we suggest a Standard SSD . Advanced : We recommend using managed disks that have better performance and reliability. Data disks : If you don't have a disk ready, click Create and attach new disk . In the dialog box, specify the disk name, size in GiB (must meet Unravel's minimum requirements ), and source type of \"empty disk\". Otherwise, click Attach an existing disk . Click Next: Networking . On the Networking tab, enter values for the following fields: Virtual network (required): Select the appropriate virtual network for your cluster(s). Subnet (required): Select a subnet with the appropriate address range based on the number of IPs you plan to have in your network . NIC network security group: Set this to Basic . Add an inbound security policy to allow SSH access and 443 access to the Unravel node. The default security policy should allow all access within the VNET. Default rules start with a priority of 65000. Click Review + create . Click Create . It takes about 2 minutes to create your VM. When Azure completes the creation of your VM, click Go to resource . Copy the VM's public IP address. Open an SSH session to your VM's public IP address to verify that your IP address is reachable: ssh -i ssh-key user @ ip-address Verify that eth0 on the new VM is bound to the private IP address shown in the Azure portal. ifconfig\neth0 Link encap:Ethernet HWaddr 00:0d:3a:1b:c2:48\n inet addr:10.10.1.96 2. Configure the VM Install ntpd , start it at boot time, and check whether time is accurate. This is necessary in order to synchronize your VM's clock. sudo su -\nyum install ntp\nntpd -u ntp:ntp Disable Security Enhanced Linux (SELinux) permanently. This is important because HDFS maintains replication in different nodes\/racks, so setting firewall rules in SELinux will lead to performance degradation. sudo setenforce Permissive In \/etc\/selinux\/config , set SELINUX=permissive to make sure the settings persist after reboot: SELINUX=permissive Install libaio.x86_64 . Libaio has a huge performance benefit over the standard POSIX asynchronous I\/O facility because the operations are performed in the Linux kernel instead of as a separate user process. sudo yum -y install libaio.x86_64 Install lzop.x86_64 . Hadoop requires LZO compression libraries. sudo yum install lzop.x86_64 Disable the firewall and check your iptable rules. sudo systemctl disable firewalld\nsudo systemctl stop firewalld\nsudo iptables -F\nsudo iptables -L Prepare the second disk (for example, \/dev\/sdc ) with at least 500 GB that was configured previously on Azure portal. Use fdisk -l to check any 500GB disk without partition.

Install Unravel Server on the VM Download the Unravel Server RPM. Install the Unravel Server RPM: sudo rpm -ivh unravel- version .rpm This installation creates the following directories, databases, and users: Directories : The installation creates \/usr\/local\/unravel\/ which contains the executables, scripts, and settings ( \/usr\/local\/unravel\/etc\/unravel.properties ). \/etc\/init.d\/unravel_* contains scripts for controlling the Unravel services \/etc\/init.d\/unravel_all.sh can be used to manually stop, start, restart, and get the status of all daemons in the proper order. Subsequent RPM upgrades don't change \/usr\/local\/unravel\/etc\/unravel.properties because your site-specific properties are put into this file. Users : User unravel is created if it does not already exist. Config : The master configuration file is \/usr\/local\/unravel\/etc\/unravel.properties . Logs : All logs are in \/usr\/local\/unravel\/logs\/ Grant access to Unravel Server: By default, a Public IP should be assigned to the Unravel VM. Create a security policy that allows SSH access on to the Unravel VM through port 443. It is recommended that you use an SSH key to access the Unravel node. 6. Configure Unravel Server with basic options Open an SSH session to the Unravel VM. ssh -i ssh-private-key ssh-user @ unravel-host Set correct permissions on the Unravel configuration directory. cd \/usr\/local\/unravel\/etc\nsudo chown unravel:unravel *.properties\nsudo chmod 644 *.properties In \/usr\/local\/unravel\/etc\/unravel.properties , add\/modify the following properties: Set general properties: com.unraveldata.onprem=false\ncom.unraveldata.cluster.type=DB\ncom.unraveldata.python.enabled=false\ncom.unraveldata.tagging.enabled=true Optionally modify the following properties: com.unraveldata.spark.appLoading.delayForRetry=60000\ncom.unraveldata.databricks.http.conn.timeout=5\ncom.unraveldata.databricks.http.read.timeout=10 Allow network access to the Unravel VM from Databricks workspaces: Assign public IP and add firewall rules to open the required ports as follows. Databricks cluster nodes are created in their own virtual network \"workers-vnet\". And for these cluster nodes access to Unravel VM’s secured service endpoint, you need to open Unravel VM’s secured service endpoints to the public. This means Unravel secure services ports (3000, 4043, and 4443) need to be opened to the public on Unravel VM’s virtual network and then mapped to Unravel VM, by following the steps below. Log into the Azure portal. Click Virtual Machines service and select the Unravel VM. Click Networking . The networking settings of the Unravel VM are displayed. The settings include the virtual network, subnet, and security group which the VM is currently using. Click Inbound port rule . Add an inbound rule to the network security group to allow port 3000, 4043 and 4443 on the internal IP address of the Unravel VM. In the screenshot below, the internal IP address of the Unravel VM is 10.10.1.63 . You should now see the following three inbound rules added to the network security group: Rule name Port Protocol Source Destination Allow_port_3000_to_Unravel_VM 3000 Any Any Unravel_VM_internal_IP Allow_port_4043_to_Unravel_VM 4043 Any Any Unravel_VM_internal_IP Allow_port_4443_to_Unravel_VM 4443 Any Any Unravel_VM_internal_IP For unsecured access... Unravel supports unsecured SSL\/TLS communication between the Unravel VM, Databricks Sensor, and Btrace agents running on Databricks nodes. To enable unnsecured SSL communication, follow these steps. Update properties related to the log receiver: \/\/ HTTP server port\ncom.unraveldata.live.logreceiver.port (default: 4043)\n\n\/\/ HTTPS server port (negative means disabled), with positive value the SSL is enabled\ncom.unraveldata.live.logreceiver.port.https (default: -1) \n\n\/\/ KeyStore file path\ncom.unraveldata.server.ssl.cert_path (default: null)\n\n\/\/ KeyStore password\ncom.unraveldata.server.ssl.cert_password (default: null) \n\n\/\/ Log network activity. Use only for debugging purposes.\ncom.unraveldata.server.log_network_activity (default: false) If the log receiver's certificate changes, add the new certificate to BTrace and Hive Hook trust stores (see SSL\/TLS support for BTrace and SSL\/TLS support for Hive Hook). Run the databricks_setup .sh script with the unsecured SSL flag ( -e true ): Generate Databricks personal access token for all workspaces . In the Generate New Token dialog, enter these settings: Workspace name Workspace ID Databricks instance Databricks personal access token Unravel uses this token to authenticate and access Databricks REST API and DBFS CLI. For information on how to generate the token, see https:\/\/docs.databricks.com\/api\/latest\/authentication.html#generate-a-token Unlike passwords, tokens expire and can be revoked. If a token expires, replace it with a new one and re-run databricks_setup.sh . To identify expired tokens, check the Unravel logs (look for \"authentication errors\") and Unravel UI (look for missing Databricks metadata). Enable token-based authentication . Install DBFS CLI on the Azure VM host . This CLI needs a Python version newer than 2.7.9. Run databricks_setup.sh to install Unravel agents on Azure Databricks workspaces. 7. Start Unravel services sudo \/etc\/init.d\/unravel_all.sh restart 8. Log into Unravel UI Run the echo command to find the URL for Unravel UI. If you're using an SSH tunnel or HTTP proxy, you might need to make adjustments to the host\/IP of the URL: echo \"http:\/\/(hostname -f):3000\/\" Create an SSH tunnel to access the Azure VM for Unravel's TCP port 3000. ssh -i ssh-private-key ssh-user @ unravel-host -L 3000:127.0.0.1:3000 Using a supported web browser , navigate to http:\/\/127.0.0.1:3000 and log in as user admin with password unraveldata . Congratulations! Unravel Server is up and running. Proceed to . " },

When you integrate Matomo with Unravel you get information on page visits in Unravel UI. You can co-locate Matomo with Unravel Server or install it on a separate host. Make sure that your Matomo host meets the sizing requirements for tracking 100,000 pageviews per month . Matomo has no data collection or storage limits , so if you need to adjust your MySQL database size, follow their instructions . Matomo works with RHEL 6.0-7.6 and CentOS 6.10-7.6. It is only available for Unravel 4.5.1.2 and onward. Install NGINX. yum install epel-release\nyum install nginx Install PHP.

"body" : "Usage Detail has six tabs: Infrastructure Jobs Nodes Impala Usage Kafka HBase One of the most difficult challenges in managing multi-tenant Hadoop clusters is understanding how resources are being used by the apps running in the clusters. Through Usage Details , Unravel Web UI provides a unique forensic view into each cluster's key performance indicators (KPIs) over time and how they relate to the apps running in the cluster. For example, Unravel can pinpoint the apps causing a sudden spike in the total vCores or memory MB usage. This lets you easily drill down into the apps to understand their behavior.

Why use sessions when Unravel already offers insights and recommendations on an app's run? You direct the tuning goal.

Repeatedly tune the app until Unravel has no more recommendations. Your session is saved and can be run again, e.g., new runs added, cluster configuration changed. You can tune: Spark Hive on MapReduce Alternatively, you can Sessions simply as a tool to compare two runs of the same app. The Sessions tab opens displaying all current sessions sorted on Sessions Name in ascending order. The Start Time is the time of the most recent app run. Number of Apps is the number of runs inside the Session. Some of these runs were added when the session was created and some were created when the recommendations. The four KPIs Duration , IO , vCore Seconds , and Memory Seconds are essentially what the fine-tuning hopes to minimize. The column contains a trend line which plots all the apps (vertices) contained in the Session. Beneath the trend line the average and the best value is noted. For example, VCore9 , has 3 apps, for Duration the average is 19 m 24 s and the best time was 38.31% better than this. You can't draw the conclusion that the same app performed best for each KPI. Finally, the Cluster ID is listed. You can sort the table on Session Name , Start Time , and Cluster . Click the edit button to edit the session. You can search for a session by name. Enter the string in the search box; any session name matching or containing the string will be displayed. " },

"body" : "Displays your cluster's YARN apps' workload across a date range using the following views: Month - by date, for example, October 10. Hour - by hour regardless of date, for example, 10.00 - 11.00. Day - by weekday regardless of date, for example, Tuesday. Hour\/Day - by hour for a given weekday, for example, 10.00 -11.00 on Tuesday. You can filter each view by App Count , vCores Hour , and Memory Hour . To measure the vCores or Memory Hour usage is straightforward; at any given point the Memory or vCore is being used or not. The App Count isn't a count of unique app instances because apps can span boundaries, i.e., begin and end in different hours\/days. The App Count reflects the apps that were running within that interval up to and including the boundary, i.e., date, hour, day. Therefore, an app can be counted multiple times in time slice. On multiple dates, for example, October 11 and 12. In multiple hours, for example, 10 PM, 11 PM & 12 AM. On multiple days, Thursday & Friday. In multiple hour\/day slots. This results in anomalies where the Sum(24 hours in Hour\/Day App Count) > Sum(App Counts for dates representing the day) . For instance, in the below example: App Count for Wednesdays (October 10, 17, and 24) = 2492, and App Count across Hour\/Day intervals for Wednesday = 2526. We point this out not because it necessarily has a significant impact in how you can use the data, but to inform you such variations exist. The tab opens in the Month view filtered on App Count for the past 24 hours. Use the Date Range date picker to change the range. We suggest using a short range as the longer the range the more processing time consumed. Click App Count , vCores Hour , and Memory Hour to change the display metric. The metric you select is used for all subsequent views until changed. Click View By to change between views. Immediately above the graph it textually notes the metric being used for the time range. When the date range is greater than one day the Hour , Day , and Hour\/Day views allow you to display the data by either as an Average or Sum . See Drilling Down below for information on how to retrieve the detailed information within each view. Hour, day and hour\/day view These graphs don't link jobs to any specific date at the graph level. For instance, the Hour graph shows that 856 jobs ran at 2 AM (between 2 AM and 3 AM); the Day graph that 2,492 jobs ran on Wednesday, and the Hour\/Day that 68 jobs ran at 2 am on a Wednesday. But none of these graphs directly indicate the date these jobs ran on. Only the Month view visually links job counts to a specific date; above we see October 10 had an app count of 822. Each view opens using the metric selected for the prior view. For instance, if vCores Hour is used to display Month and you switch to Day it is filtered using vCores Hour . When the DATE RANGE spans multiple days, you have the choice to display the data as either the: Sum - aggregated sum of job count, vCore or memory hour during the time range (default view). Average - Sum \/ (# of Days in Date Range). Day view Displays the jobs run on a specific weekday. Hover over an interval for its details. Click the interval to drill down into it. Hour\/Day view This view shows the intersection of Hour and Day graphs.

(When you schedule a user report your choice of Date Range is constrained.) Enter the number of apps ( Top X ) to include in the report. To filter by a subset of Users , Real Users , or Queues click in the text box below it for a list of values. To filter on Tags (when available), select the box next to the tag and then click in the selection box for the available values. Click a value to select it; once selected to deselect it click the x next to it. You can select zero or more values. Click Run . Running replaces Run and a countdown is displayed until Unravel starts collecting the data. A dark green banner is briefly displayed noting that \"Top X Started\". New Report pulsates blue while the report is being generated. When Unravel is unable to start the report, a red banner containing an error message is displayed. When the report is successfully completed, a light green bar appears noting \"Top X Completed Successfully\". The report displays up to the top X apps per app type. The number of apps displayed can vary by app type. You can download the report by clicking the Download JSON button. The downloaded report is unfiltered and contains the information for Hive, Impala, and Spark. If Unravel was unable to generate the report, an error message in a light red bar is displayed and New Report becomes orange. Click the Filter By option to switch between the app types. The first tile is Top X Report: Input Parameters . The number of apps ( Top X ) and Date Range are always listed since they are required. Any optional parameters selected are also listed. On the right-hand side is the Report Id which the report is archived under. The report itself is composed of three tiles. (Note: the information can vary by app type). The Applications tile lists by app type: Total Apps: Number of apps on the cluster. Successful Apps: Number of apps that have successfully completed. Failed Apps: Number of apps that have failed to complete. Others: Number of apps that were killed, or those that are in a pending, running, waiting, or unknown state. Immediately beneath the Application Summary are five tables showing the top X apps for each category. Specific apps can be listed in multiple tables. If there are less than X apps, each table contains all the apps sorted on the metric. Regardless of app type, the table has the following columns: Status: The status of the app: success, failed, killed, or running. User: The app's owner. Real User: The User who actually submitted the job, for example, jdoe@company.com. The real user may be different from User . ID: The app's ID, hover over it for the full id. CPU: The app's CPU usage over the lifetime of the app. Memory: The app's memory usage. # Events: The total events the app had. Tags: Tags associated with the app. If you are filtering based upon tags only apps with matching tags are displayed. All the tags for the app are displayed. App Parent: App's parent. Each app type also has app specific columns, specifically Hive : Query Snippet and App Parent (links to the app's parent when applicable). Impala : Query Snippet . Spark : # Spark Stages and # Spark Tasks . No Data Found is listed when there is no information for the available for the app type. The longest duration, highest CPU usage, and highest memory usage tables These tables vary by app type, but within the app type they are the same. Each table displays the top X apps for the metric. Examples: Hive Impala Spark The highest disks I\/O usage and highest cluster usage tables These tables are similar to those above except the DURATION column is replaced by the metric. Examples: Hive Impala Spark Resources This tile varies by app type, but always has up to top ten Queues sorted by App Count . Examples: Hive Impala Spark Data Lists the Total Read I\/O and Total Write I\/O across all apps for the app type. Example Spark report. User report This report is designed for a variety of end users, for instance: App developers who can use it to determine what apps need attention to improve duration, resource usage, etc. Team leaders or managers who can use it to track how the team uses resources and identify user's who overuse resources (rogue users). It provides a concise and clear view of: How apps are performing on the platform. The resources the apps are using. The number of recommendations or insights Unravel has for the app. This report is like the Top X report above except the columns are ordered differently. Click Schedule User Report to bring up the Report:User modal. You must enter a Schedule Name . The Scheduling information defaults to Daily and the current time. Change the schedule to the time you want the report to run and how often. At the bottom is a table listing the configurations you have added. The table lists all the available tags and you can see what has been selected for each user. You can add multiple configurations but must have at least one. See Adding configurations manually for using Add New Configuration and Bulk Upload for adding multiple configurations via a CSV file. Once you have finished, click Save Schedule. Click to close the modal; if you close it before saving all your input is lost. Adding a configuration manually Click Add New Configuration , the modal is like the Top X one above except you have a limited History (Date Range) and an Email text box. You can use the default settings, but you must enter an email. Multiple configurations do not have to match, but each configuration must have a unique email. If you want to send multiple reports to the same User you must create a new User report for the configuration. As with all reports, when you do not select an option, the report is left unfiltered on that option. For example, if you don't select a subset of Users , a report is generated for the top X across all users. In the example above, the two configurations only have the Date Range and Top X number in common. Once a configuration is entered, click to edit it and to delete it. Bulk Upload Import Data from CSV lets you upload a CSV file containing configurations for multiple users. Unlike when you manually enter configuration, you cannot specify a Date Range as Unravel automatically sets it to seven days. Unravel parses the complete file, rejecting any malformed entries, or those containing a duplicate email. The new report modal lists the possible columns, these can vary based by cluster. Here we have two user defined tags, dept and project. For each column you need to know the possible values. (When you enter the configuration manually Unravel provides you with all possibilities.) In this example, there are eleven possible columns as the Date Range and Action columns are irrelevant. You do not have to include (define) all the column headers or order them the same. However, whatever columns\/tags you include must be defined for all entries in the order you chose. You must define an email column. Any column\/tag which is not added to the CSV, or left undefined for a configuration is unfiltered. For instance, if Users is undefined, the report is generated across all users. CSV Format: Col header1,Col header2,Col header3, ... \/\/ up to the number of possible options\nentry1, entry2, entry3, ... \/\/ up to the number of columns defined\n In the following example, the CSV file only defines five columns Email (required), Top X , Users , RealUsers , and Dept . Therefore, the reports are not filtered by Queue , Project , DBS , Inputtables or Outputtables . topx,email,Users,realUsers,dept\n6,a@unraveldata.com,hdfs,hdfs,eng \/\/ all columns are defined, entry is accepted\n10,b@unraveldata.com,root,,eng \/\/ realUsers is defined as empty, entry is accepted\n7,b@unraveldata.com,root,,eng \/\/ duplicate email, the entry is rejected \n7,z@unraveldata.com,,,test,root,fin \/\/ 2 extra columns were added, the entry is rejected\n7,y@unraveldata.com,root,,eng \/\/ realUsers is defined as empty, entry is accepted The UI lists the results of the CSV import. In this case only lines 1, 2, and 5 were loaded. See above for the explanation. Once you have loaded the configuration you can click to edit it a configuration manually or to delete it.

"body" : "Overview Migration Planning helps you to understand your current cluster's configuration, its current usage and then helps you plan your migration to cloud such that you can achieve it in a faster and more cost-efficient way. Cluster Discovery analyzes your on-prem cluster usage, workload patterns, and your hosts' hardware configuration. Clouding Mapping provides an optimal cloud topology based on your on-prem cluster and an estimate of how much it would cost. Unravel provides this information for two migration strategies. Lift and Shift is a one-to-one mapping of each existing host’s capacity (based on CPU, memory, and disk) to the closest fit on the cloud that meets or exceeds the host's hardware specs. This method provides an estimate of what your current on-prem cluster configuration would cost on the cloud. It doesn't consider workload or actual resource usage. It is the more expensive way to migrate, but it minimizes your risks associated with migrating to the cloud Cost Reduction is a-one-to-one mapping of each existing host’s actual usage (based on CPU, memory, and disk) to the closest fit on the cloud that meets or exceeds the host's usage requirements. While still a one-to-one mapping, this method is usually more cost-effective than lift and shift as it minimizes over-provisioning (the under-utilization of your host's resources). This method optimizes for cost, but not necessarily peak-usage. If your on-prem hosts are under-utilized this method is usually less expensive than lift and shift. Services and versions compatibility compares what is on your cluster and the component versions offered by the target you selected for the report. The reports are generated based upon an analysis of your cluster workload over a specific date range. You can: Analyze on-prem HDP, CDH clusters. Examine the costs of running your clusters on: Prior to Unravel 4.5.3.0 only a subset of these cloud services are available Google Compute Engine (IaaS) Google DataProc Amazon EC2 (Iaas) Amazon EMR Azure (Iaas) Azure HDInsight Limitations Your cluster must have at least seven days of metrics for Unravel to generate useful reports. Clusters running MapR Control System aren't supported. In order to use Migration Planning Reports you must have OnDemand installed, and set the cluster manager properties.

Clouding Mapping per Host is a report organized by host that shows the host details and the cloud instance it was mapped to. As of Unravel 4.5.3.0 the information in the Clouding Mapping per Instance tab has been merged into this tab. Services and Versions Compatibility maps the services on your cluster to either Google DataProc, Amazon EMR, and Azure HDInsight, and determines what services are both available and compatible on the cloud product. Cloud mapping per instance (deprecated Unravel 4.5.3.0) This tab provides a summary of the Clouding Mapping per Host reports. By default, the tab opens displaying the last report generated for Lifet and Shift . This report is the instance view of the migration. It shows the Instance name, # of Cores , Memory and the Number of Hosts which were mapped to the instance. There is one row for each instance Unravel mapped one or more hosts to.

On-Prem Cluster Identity This tile contains information about your cluster, including the hosts. The Host Summary section shows the cluster's capacity across all hosts. To see each host's hardware specifications and the host's roles click . The table can be searched on host name. The potential roles are: Server: Has at least one server component, such as Zookeeper Server, HDFS. Worker: Has at least one daemon component such as HDFS DataNode, YARN NodeManager, or HBase RegionServer. Client: Has at least one client component, such as Zookeeper Client, Hadoop Client, Hive Client, etc. Cluster overall usage of applications grouped by app type, user, and queue. The donut graphs display the top 10 for each category. This example has three app types, four users, and six queues over the period analyzed. Cluster resource availability and usage The first two graphs display the cluster's CPU and memory utilization over the time period. The average usage is listed on the right-hand side of the tile bar. Hover over the parenthetical text next to the resource's name to see Unravel's analysis of your cluster's usage for that resource. Here, the CPU and Memory are both \"Very under-utilized and over-provisioned\". The heat-map is a map of the CPU\/Memory usage and capacity by a weekday and hour, e.g., Monday between 5 and 6 a.m. Each time slot is color coded to show how relatively hot the time slot is relative to the rest of the map. You can quickly see the load distribution across your cluster.age. You can filter the heatmap by CPU or memory. It opens displaying CPU. The CPU graph above noted the CPU is under-utilized and the heatmap graphically supports that analysis. " },

Since Unravel is matching capacity, the mapped instance is also underutilized with a Total Hourly Cost of 2.211. Cost Reduction This method maps each host to an instance based on the host's actual usage not its capacity. This report maps the same host used in the Lift and Shift report. The Total Hourly Cost is $1.147, a saving of $1.064. Comparison of lift and shift to cost reduction Both Lift and Shift and Cost Reduction perform a one-to-one mapping, but Cost Reduction typically is less expensive since it maps host to a VM based upon the host's actual usage.

"body" : "This displays your instance workload, so you can see when your workload is heaviest, etc. It displays the workload by: Month: By date, for example, July 30. Hour: By hour regardless of date, for example, 10.00 - 11.00. Day: By weekday regardless of date, e.g., Tuesday. Hour\/Day: By hour for a given weekday, e.g.,10.00 -11.00 on Tuesday (a heatmap). The app count is not a count of unique app instances because apps can span boundaries, i.e., begin and end in different hours\/days. The app count reflects the apps that were running within that interval up to and including the boundary, i.e., date, hour, day. Therefore, an app can be counted multiple times in any given time period. On multiple dates, or example, July 30 and 31. In multiple hours, for example, 2 AM and 3 AM. On multiple days, Tuesday and Wednesday. In multiple hour\/day slots. This results in anomalies where the Sum(24 hours in Hour\/Day app count) > Sum(app counts for dates representing the day) . We point this out not because it necessarily has a significant impact in how you can use the data, but to inform you such variations exist. When you can specify a date range or instance, the pull down menus are on the right-hand side of the Operational Insights title bar. We recommend using a short date range, as bigger ranges take up more processing time. By default, it opens showing the Month tab for the past week across all instances. Click the View By buttons to change between views. For the Hour , Day and Hour\/Day you can view the data as an Average or Sum . See Drilling Down below for information on how to retrieve the detailed information within each view. Month view Displays the jobs run by date. The color indicates how the day's load compares with the other days within the date range. The day with the least jobs\/hours is , while the days with the highest load are . Therefore, the color of any particular day varies in context to the other days being displayed. For example, when only one day is displayed it is colored . Use Previous and Next in the month's title bar to navigate between months. Hour, day and hour\/day view These graphs do not link jobs to any specific date. For instance, the Hour graph shows that 11 jobs ran at 2 AM (between 2 AM and 3 AM); the Day graph that 78 jobs ran on Wednesday, and the Hour\/Day that five jobs ran at 2 am on a Wednesday. But none of these graphs indicate the date these jobs ran on. Only the Month view links the job counts to a specific date; above we see 22 July had an app count of 77. You have the choice to display the data as either the: Sum: Aggregated sum of job count during the time range (default view). Average: Aggregated sum of job count average across the time slice, for instance (Sum of all jobs which ran on Wednesday)\/(Number of Wednesday's in the Sample). Day view Displays the jobs run on a specific weekday. Hover over an interval for its details. Click the interval to drill down into it. Hour\/Day view This view shows the intersection of Hour and Day graphs, it's basically a heatmap. The Hour graph showed 11 jobs ran between at 2-3 AM while the Day graph (immediately above) shows that 78 jobs ran on Wednesday. Below we see that five of Wednesday's jobs ran between 2-3 AM. " },

Overview The Overview Dashboard gives a quick view into the tables' and partitions' sizes, usage, and KPIs. It has two sections. Table KPI Partition The time period used to populate the page is noted in the upper right-hand corner and the tool tips. Tables & partitions tiles Both Table and Partition KPIs sections contain: # Accessed: Number of tables\/partitions accessed. # Created: Number of tables\/partitions created. Size Created: Size of tables\/partition created. # Total: Total number of tables\/partition currently in the system. The Table KPIs also contains: Accessed Queries: Total number of queries accessing the tables. Total Size: Total size of all the tables. # of Users: Number of users in the last 24 hours. Donut charts These display the Current Label Distribution for the tables\/partitions. See Configuration for the operating definition of the labels. The graph shows the relationship between the labels; hover over a label to see the total of tables\/partitions with that label. Below we see that three tables are warm. Details The details tab has two sections, a graph and a table list. By default, the graph uses the Total Users metric and displays the first table in the list. The list is sorted on Total Users in descending order. You can also use the metrics Total Users, Total Apps, or Total Size to display the graph. The Total Apps metric (corresponding Apps column in the table) is the total number of Hive and Impala queries on the table. Graph Use the Metric pull down menu to select Total Users , Total Apps , or Total Size as the metric to graph. Click Reset Graph to revert to displaying first table using the Total Users metric. Select the menu bars to print or download the graph as a XLS or CSV file. Select the checkbox next to the table's name to dispaly the table information. You can select tables over multiple pages. In the example below we have selected the first three tables. Between the graph and the table list you can choose how to filter graph and tables based upon their table activity, All , Warm , Cold , or Hot . Click Download CSV to download the table. Click Configure Policy to set the conditions for determining whether a table is Warm , Cold , or Hot . You can Search by string; any table matching or containing the name\/string is displayed. All is selected below, so every table is shown. You can sort the list by the various metrics in ascending or descending order. By default, the list is sorted on Table Name in ascending order. If you have selected a table, the More Info glyph is available. Click it to display the Table Detail view. Click Configure Policy to edit the label rules or Download CSV to download the table list. Table List Table detail This view: Summarizes table usage and access metric. Lets you to browse trends (KPIs). Drill down into apps that used the table. Lists both Hive and Impala queries. The first table in the list above is used for the examples below. The panel's top row lists the table name, start date\/time and the name\/path. Hover over the name\/path to display the complete path. Three KPIs are displayed: Users , # Apps, and Size . There are three tabs, Table Detail , Partition Detail , and Retention Detail (1); the default view is the Table Detail .

"body" : "Overview A Spark app consists of one or more Jobs, which in turn has one or more Stages. Job : corresponds to a Spark action, for example, count, take, foreach. The Spark APM lets you: Quickly see which jobs and stages consumed the most resources. View your app as a RDD execution graph . Drill into the source code from the stage tile, Spark stream batch tile, or the execution graph to locate the problems. You can use the APM to analyze an app's behavior to: Resolve inefficiencies, bottlenecks, and reasons for failure within apps. Optimize resource allocation for Spark driver and executors. Detect and fix poor partitioning. Detect and fix inefficient and failed Spark apps. Tune JVM settings for driver and executors. Unravel provides insights into Spark apps and potentially tuning recommendations. There are multiple Spark app types and the Spark APM's information can vary by the app type. Currently, Unravel distinguishes between: Scala, Java, and PySpark SQL-Query Streaming Regardless of the app type and how they are submitted (for example, from Notebooks, Spark shells, or spark-submit), the Spark APMs are similar and there are common tabs\/information across all types. The Spark APM's basic layout A black title bar notes the type of tile (Spark, Job, Stage, etc). On the right side there are actions ( ), comment ( ), and minimize ( ) glyph. For jobs and stages instead of actions there is a , click it to see the job's or stage's parent. A running Spark streaming app lets you toggle the auto refresh so you can examine the app without the APM constantly refreshing.

Job Information: Job number, owner, queue, cluster and start\/stop time. In Unravel for Azure Databricks the Job information is more detailed. First line: Run creator, Instance name. Second line: Cluster Id, Cluster Name, Start and End time of the run. Third line: Workspace Id, Workspace Name, Job Id, Run Name, Run Id, Number in job. KPIs: these vary by job type. The last section, divided in half, has specific information related to the app. The sections for a specific Spark Application (for example, Streaming) go into more detail. If the app is composed of tasks\/jobs\/stages they appear on the left side under Navigation or Stream . Clicking a row brings up detailed information about it in a separate tile\/panel. When there is an Auto Action column ( ), the number of events associated with the stage is listed. Click to toggle the display of the job tile. As of Unravel 4.5.2.0, a left-hand tab isn't displayed if there is no data available, e.g., the Conf tab isn't shown if there is no configuration information. The Graphs tab isn't shown if there is no data available. When a graph has less than four data points, the graph is converted to a bar graph. Common tabs Except for the Spark streaming app, the Application Manager view is split into two sections The sections contain the following tabs. A tab is only displayed if there is data. Left tabs Errors: Lists all errors associated with the app. The errors are color coded (fatal , errors , warnings ) and the number for each type noted. The total number of errors is listed at the top. They are grouped by executors with the number and types of errors noted. Errors are categorized by severity, and include keywords and details associated with each. Keywords help to extract important details from the error messages\/log data to help quickly root out the cause of a problem. If there are no errors, then \"No errors found\" is listed. Logs: The critical logs that were collected for this Spark app. No Logs Found is displayed when Unravel is unable to load any log information. Click the log name to see it, this example is an excerpt of the executor-20 log. Conf: The configuration parameters and their values. The tab opens listing all the properties, according to app\/task\/job. The number of properties displayed is noted above the list. You can narrow the list by choosing the configuration type to display; to see the Spark version select metadata. Metadata and driver are selected in this example and the list narrowed from 1042 to two properties. Some properties appear in multiple categories, e.g., spark.executor.extraJavaOptions is listed under Memory, Driver and Executor. You can search by name; searching on YARN displays every property containing the word yarn. Click Reset to display all properties. Right tabs Program: Displays the program's source code if available. Both the Spark Stage and Execution graph link to this tab and display code related to the tab. See Uploading Spark Programs . Task Attempts: Graphically and textually notes the number of tasks and their status. The donut graphs show the percentage of successful (green), failed (orange), and killed (red) tasks. A legend on the right lists the number of each. The following graph on the left shows a job in which all tasks succeeded, while the on the right has all failed tasks. Frequently, the result is a combination. Hovering over the chart tells you the percentage of each. Graphs: There are three types of graphs. Graphs use \"wall clock time\" as opposed to computer usage time. This tab isn't shown when there is no data available. Running Containers: The number of running containers. vCores: Allocated vCores. Memory: Allocated memory. Resource: Graphs the resources the app\/job\/stage consumed. When no resource data is available the tab displays No metrics found. Metrics are displayed after Unravel has processed the app completely and Unravel's application sensors are enabled. By default, the graph displays all executors using the metric availableMemory . Beneath the list notes the page, if more than one, that is being displayed. Click the arrow to page down or up to display a page. Choose the metric for the graph using the pull-down menu. The metrics fall into one of the following categories: OS Memory, CPU, and Java Memory. Click Get Data to see the resource information displayed in JSON. You can toggle whether a resource is displayed by clicking on it; it is greyed out when it's not displayed. You choose one or more series to display using the Select box. Clicking within the box brings up a list of all resources available. Click the resource you want to display. You can choose to display from one to all resources. Only the chosen resources are listed at the bottom of the box. Click the X next to the resource to remove it from the list. This example of the JSON shown when yoyu click Get Data . Common tiles Scala, Java, PySpark, and SQL-Query navigation tab The Navigation tab isn't shown if there is no data available. Navigation: The app's jobs with their relevant KPIs: Status , Start Time , Duration , Tasks , DFS Read , DFS Write , Stages . The jobs are sorted by Start Time in descending order. While the app is running, the Status column displays the job's completion percentage. The Tasks and Stages columns show the (current number completed)\/(total). In the following image, Job ID 1 is 41% complete. This tab updates every 60 seconds. However, the live data that Unravel receives is only updated upon: The start of a Spark Job. The completion of a Spark task, job or stage. This tab isn't shown if there is no information\/data available. Once completed the total number of the Tasks and Stages are shown along with the number skipped. In this example, 39,600 Tasks and 99 Stages were skipped. Click a job row to bring up its details in a Job Block. You can open the job even if it's running. The job block lists the KPIs Duration and # of Stages . It has three tabs, Stages , Gannt , and Metadata . The default view is the Stages tab. The stage table lists ID , Status , Start Time , Duration , Tasks (Complete\/Total), Shuffle Read , Shuffle Write , Input (total data read by the app), and Output (total data written by the app). By default, the stages are sorted by Start Time in descending order. Click a stage to bring up its details in a tile. See Spark Stage . This example is for Job 1 above, which is only 41% complete. Here the # of Stages lists 199, but only 82 completed jobs are listed in the table. As jobs are completed they are added to the table. " },

Click the Cluster Name to bring up the Cluster View . Cluster view This window has three sections: Key performance indicators Metric graphs Table of Kafka topics Key performance indicators # Under Replicated Partitions # Offline Partitions # Controller Bytes In\/sec Bytes Out\/sec Messages in\/sec Metrics This section has three tabs: Metrics : Graphs the metrics for the data across the entire cluster. Broker : Graphs the metric for the data of the broker you select from the broker list. Topic : Graphs the metric data for a specific topic you select from the topic list. Metrics The Metrics and Broker tab graphs all the following Metrics. The Topic tab displays a subset of the Metrics. In addition, subsets of these Metrics are used in the Topic and Consumer Group pages. While the definition of the metric is the same throughout, the breadth of the collected data is not. Therefore, the implication\/interpretation of the metric varies by context. For each metric, we explain: Its definition. Whether it is used in Topic tab or the Topic and Consumer pages' Topic details tab. The data collected for the metric at each point. For some Metrics, the implication or interpretation of data at the point of collection is explained; along with how you can use it to monitor your cluster or improve its performance. In addition to these Metrics the Topic and Consumer pages Partition tab graphs the partition's Consumer lag and offset. Bytes In Per Second The one minute rate of all the bytes flowing into the Kafka network, specifically the Kafka Producers publishing messages. It indicates how much traffic the brokers are receiving from the Producer clients. This metric is also displayed in the Topic tab and the Topic and Consumer group views. For any given data point, for that point in time, the graph displays: Metrics tab: The total number of bytes flowing into the cluster across all topics and brokers. Broker tab: The number of bytes flowing into the selected broker. Topic tab: The number of bytes flowing into a particular topic across all brokers. Topic view: The same as the Topic tab, but each broker is represented by a trend line so you can see the data flowing into individual topics. Consumer group view: Similar to the Topic page. Analysis: The Brokers tab can help you determine if you need to expand your cluster. There might be situations where it could be possible to identify a broker that is receiving more traffic than others which indicates that there is a need for a partition rebalance. Bytes Out Per Second The one minute rate of all the bytes flowing out of the Kafka network, specifically Kafka Consumers consuming messages from the topics. This metric scales differently than Bytes In Per Second , because of the great job Kafka does handling multiple consumers. It possible for the outgoing rate to be two to three times the incoming rate for topics bring consumed. Before Kafka 0.11.0.0, this metric included the internal replica traffic. Therefore, it showed an outbound rate for a topic that was an actively producing client, even when no consumers were consuming from the same. This metric is also displayed in the Topic tab and the Topic and Consumer group pages. These graphs are exactly like Bytes In Per Second except they display the bytes out. Messages In Per Second The number of messages produced per second. While Bytes In Per Second displays the broker traffic in absolute terms of bytes, this is the number (count) of individual messages that flow in, regardless of their size. This metric is also displayed in the Topic tab and the Topic and Consumer group views. For any given data point, the graph displays, for that point in time: Metrics tab: The total number of messages produced in the cluster across all topics and brokers. Broker tab: The number of messages being written into the selected broker. Topic tab: The number of messages flowing into the selected topic. Topic view: The same as the Topic tab. Each topic, is represented by a trend line so you can see the number of message flowing into each broker. Consumer group view: Similar to the Topic page. Analysis: Useful for end users who are more interested in the message count rather than the network throughput. When used in conjunction with Bytes in Per Seconds you can estimate the size of a single message. Like Bytes in Per Seconds it can help identify broker imbalance so you can rebalance your partitions. Total Fetch Requests Per Second The number of consumer fetch requests sent per second. Like Bytes Out Per Second this is an indicator of the rate consumers are uptaking\/requesting messages from the Kafka cluster. This metric is also displayed in the Topic tab and the Topic view. For any given data point in the graph, for that point in time, it displays: Metrics tab: The total number of fetch requests within the cluster across all topics and brokers. Broker tab: The number of fetch requests received by the selected broker across all topics. Topic tab: The number of fetch requests received for a particular topic across all brokers. Topic view: The total number of fetch requests received for that topic. Each topic, is represented by a trend line so you can see the number of fetch requests flowing into each broker. Analysis: Care must be taken when interpreting this metric because the value also includes replica traffic, that is, the fetch requests that get raised by the brokers to keep the topic partitions in sync. Under Replicated Partitions Per Second The count of under replicated partitions existing in a cluster. Metrics tab: The trend line for under replicated partitions for the entire cluster. Broker tab: The trend line for under replicated partitions for the selected broker. Analysis: This is the metric to monitor. It can provide insight into a number of problems on a Kafka cluster ranging from a broker being down to resource exhaustion. For example, a constant number of under replicated partitions for many brokers might indicate that one of the brokers is down. The count across the cluster is equal to the number of partitions on the faulty broker. # Active Controller Trend The active controller trend line. Metrics tab: The trend line indicates the presence of an active controller for the entire cluster. Broker tab: The trend line indicates the duration for which the selected broker was an active controller. Analysis: On the cluster level the value for this metric should always be one, that is, at all times only one broker should be the active controller. Any other value could indicate the cluster might be susceptible to administrative issues such as partition reassignment, etc. On a broker level, except for the active controller, the brokers should return zero. Request Handler Idle Ratio Average Per Minute The request handler idle ratio trend over a time period. It indicates the percentage of the time the request handlers aren't in use. Metrics tab: The trend line is the metric value across the entire cluster averaged over all brokers. Broker tab: The trend line is the metric value for the selected broker. Analysis: Lower numbers indicate increased load on the broker. Anything under 0.2 (20 percent) is a cause for concern. Values under 0.1 (10 percent) usually indicate an active performance problem. Typically, there are two reasons for high thread utilization: There aren't enough threads. The threads are devoting some of their resources to overhead tasks and not servicing the client requests itself. # Partition Count The number of partitions. The count includes both leader and follower replica. It should be basically constant over time. Metrics tab: The trend line indicates the metric's value across the entire cluster averaged over all brokers. Broker tab: The trend line indicates the metric's value for the selected broker. Analysis: Expect this to be basically constant over time. This count includes both leader and follower replica. # Leader Partition Count The number of partition leaders. Metrics tab: The trend line indicates the metric's value across the entire cluster averaged over all brokers. Broker tab: The trend line indicates the metric's value for the selected broker. It represents the number of partitions for which the broker is currently a leader. Analysis: Consider monitoring this metric because it gives you a qualitative distinction between the replicas on a broker in regards to leaders and followers. Even if the replicas are balanced in size or number across the cluster, there might be a broker who has an indiscriminately large\/small number of leaders. This is an indication of imbalance. You can use this metric in conjunction with # Partition Count to calculate the percentage of partitions on broker for the partition the broker is a leader. In well-balanced clusters this should be uniform. For example, if you have a replication factor of two all brokers should be leaders of approximately 50% of their partitions. # Offline Partition Count The number of offline partitions in the cluster indicating the number of partitions in the cluster that have no leader. Metrics tab: The trend line indicates the metric's value across the entire cluster averaged over all brokers. Broker tab: The trend line indicates the metric's value for the selected broker. Analysis: Along with Under Replicated Partitions , this is a critical metric to monitor. Such partitions are inaccessible to clients because produce and fetch requests are sent only to leaders. This could result in issues like producer clients losing messages. One potential reason for the presence of offline partitions is the broker\/brokers hosting the leader replicas are down. Fetch Total Time, 99th Percentile The 99th percentile of the total turnaround time (time from receiving the request to sending a response back) the broker spends processing the fetch request. 99% of all values in a group of fetch request timing are less than this metric's value. Metrics tab: Shows the time value for the entire cluster averaged across all brokers. Broker tab: Shows the time value for the selected broker. Analysis: You can gain insight into how an average request performs and what are the outliers by correlating this metric value with the average value of the metric. Produce Total Time, 99th Percentile The 99th percentile of the total turnaround time (time from receiving the request to sending a response back) the broker spends processing the produce request. 99% of all values in a group of fetch request timing are less than this metric's value. Metrics tab: Shows the time value for the entire cluster averaged across all brokers. Broker tab: Shows the time value for the selected broker. Analysis: You can gain insight into how an average request performs and what are the outliers by correlating this metric value with the average value of the metric. You can use this to set a baseline of sorts. Much like Under Replicated Partitions , a spike in the 99 percentile for Produce requests can alert you to a wide range of performance issues. # Fetch Requests Per Sec Displays the one minute rate for all the fetch requests being received and processed. Like Bytes Out Per Sec , it is an indicator of the rate at which consumers are uptaking\/requesting messages from the Kafka cluster. Metrics tab: Shows the summation of the fetch requests being processed across all brokers per second. Broker tab: Shows the fetch requests being processed by a specific broker per second. Analysis: You must take care when interpreting this metric. In addition to the consumer client fetch request, the value also includes replica traffic, that is, the fetch requests that get raised by the brokers to keep the topic partitions in sync. # Produce Requests Per Sec Displays the one minute rate of all the Produce Requests being received and processed. Like Bytes In Per Sec , it indicates how much traffic the brokers are receiving from the Producer clients. Metrics tab: Shows the summation of the produce requests being processed across all brokers per second. Broker tab: Shows the produce requests being processed by a specific broker per second. Analysis: This metric can be useful in deciding whether to expand your cluster. Additionally, it can be helpful when tracked at the broker level. On a normal Kafka cluster the value across all brokers should be basically the same. It helps you identify a broker that is receiving more traffic than others indicating there is a need for a partition rebalance. Produce Purgatory Size The number of Produce requests sitting in the Producer Request Purgatory. It is a holding pen for requests waiting to be satisfied (Delayed). Of all Kafka request types, it is used only for Produce requests. It tracks the number of requests sitting in purgatory (including both watchers map and expiration queue). Metrics tab: The count for the entire cluster averaged across all brokers. Broker tab: The count for the selected broker. Analysis: You can use this metric as a rough gauge of memory usage. Fetch Purgatory Size The number of Fetch requests sitting in the Fetch Request Purgatory. It is a holding pen for requests waiting to be satisfied (Delayed). Of all Kafka request types, it is used only for Fetch requests. It tracks the number of requests sitting in purgatory (including both watchers map and expiration Metrics tab: The count for the entire cluster averaged across all brokers. Broker tab: The count for the selected broker. Analysis: You can use this metric as a rough gauge of memory usage. Log Flush Latency, 99th Percentile The 99th percentile value of the latency incurred by a log flush, that is, write to disk in milliseconds. 99% of all values in the group are less than the value of the metric. Metrics tab: The time value for the entire cluster averaged across all brokers Broker tab: The time value for the selected broker. Analysis: Log flushes are generally one of the most expensive operations, and can affect the durability, latency and throughput of the Kafka cluster. This trend line depicts what's the log latency like for the cluster and can help in configuring the log flush interval. Metrics tab Broker tab TOPIC tab Kafka topics list consumed by a consumer group (CG) with relevant KPIs. Click the topic to bring up the Topic view and the consumer to bring up the Consumer group view. By default it is sorted on Topic name, this table is sorted on Consumer Groups in order to see the active consumer groups. The Consumer Groups status is clearly indicated below it. See Kafka Insights for a Use Case example of locating of lagging or stalled Consumer Groups. Consumer group page Key Performance Indicators Number of Topics Number of Partitions The Topic list displays the KPIs; when details are available a more info icon is displayed. Click it to bring up the Kafka view for the topic. Below the list are two tabs which display graphs of the Topic and Partition details. By default, the window opens with the Topic Detail graph displayed. Partition Tab You can choose both the Partition and the Metric for the display. By default, the 0 th partition is displayed using the metric offset . The Partition Details ' list is populated if the details are available. Topic page The Kafka View has two tabs, Topic Detail and Partition Detail . Each view has a Consumer Details' list which is populated if the details are available. Kafka Topic Detail By default, the Kafka Topic Detail opens in the Topic Detail view which graphs the KPIs. The KPIs in the title bar, present Kafka Partition Detail You can choose both the Partition and the Metric for the display. By default, the 0 th partition will be displayed on using the metric offset . Unravel insights for Kafka Unravel provides auto-detection of lagging\/stalled Consumer Groups. It lets you drill down into your cluster and determine which consumers, topics, partitions are lagging or stalled. See Kafka Insights for a use case example of drilling down into lagging or stalled Consumer Groups. Unravel determines Consumer status by evaluating the consumer's behavior over a sliding window. For example, we use average lag trend for 10 intervals (of 5 minutes duration each), covering a 50-minute period. Consumer Status is evaluated on several factors during the window for each partition it is consuming. For a topic partition Consumer status is: Stalled : If the Consumer commit offset for the topic partition is not increasing and lag is greater than zero. Lagging : If the Consumer lag for the topic partition is increasing consistently, and an increase in lag from the start of the window to the last value is greater than lag threshold (e.g., 250). The information is distilled down into a status for each partition, and then into a single status for the consumer. A consumer is either in one of the following states: OK : The consumer is working and is current. Warning : The consumer is working, but falling behind. Error : The consumer has stopped or stalled.

Duration: Total time taken by the app to complete execution. Data I\/O: Total data read and written by the app. Tabs By default, the MapReduce APM opens in the Graphs > Attempts view. Graphs: Has four sub tabs. Attempts: Number of task attempts are charted in \"wall-clock\" time. The aggregated time of all tasks running in the Map\/Reduce slot duration is listed under the graph. Containers , vCores , and Memory: Graphs utilization of slot containers, vCores, and memory over time. When there is no data available for a graph, the tab isn't shown. When a graph has less than four data points, the graph is converted to a bar graph. Timeline: Displays the details of each MapReduce job by showing the execution of each task on the machine it was executed on. The Timeline tab is divided into two sections: A Distribution chart (which displays either the Map or Reduce tasks) A bottom table which lists either the tasks by stages on servers or the list of tasks and their associated KPIs.

"body" : "Unravel's AutoActions automates the monitoring of your compute cluster by allowing you to define complex actionable rules on different cluster metrics. You can use an AutoAction to alert you to a situation needing manual intervention, for example, resource contention or stuck jobs. Additionally, it can be set to automatically kill an app or move it to a different queue. The Unravel Server processes AutoActions by: Collecting various metrics from the cluster. Aggregating the collected metrics according to user-defined rules. Detecting rule violations. Applying defined actions for each rule violation. Each rule consists of: A logical expression that is used to aggregate cluster metrics and to evaluate the rule. A rule has two conditions: Prerequisite conditions : The conditions which cause a violation, for example, the number of jobs running, memory used. Defining conditions : Who\/what\/when can cause the violation, for example, user, apps. Actions for Unravel Server to execute whenever it detects a rule violation. Manage > Auto Actions The AutoActions tab provides a quick way to view AutoActions and quickly see their status, along with its defined actions and scope. The tab displays all defined AutoActions separated into an Active and Inactive list. You enable\/disable by clicking the check box on the left. You can edit ( ) or delete ( ) an AutoAction regardless of its status. Click to copy the AutoActions JSON code. At the top are buttons which allow you to define new AutoActions . Hovering over the AutoAction's name gives you the description which was entered when defining the AutoAction. Hovering over action or scope glyph brings up its detail. For example, for the active AutoAction above: Rule description: . Email action: an email is sent to only one person, . Queue scope: is three queues, . The Actions and Scope columns contains all available options. When an option has been set, i.e., no longer using the default setting, it is highlighted. It is possible to set an AutoAction which contains no actions, see quicktest below. Such an AutoAction simply has when it was triggered logs and retains the data. Every AutoAction must have a scope. When the AutoAction has an action or scope defined via an Expert Rule , that action or scope isn't noted in the table. The AutoAction, quicktest below, doesn't note a scope; however one was specified via an Expert Rule. The History of Runs column lists the number of times, if any, the AutoAction was triggered. Click the number to bring up its history. By default, all actions are off. Possible actions are: Send an Email ( ). Kill the App ( ). Move the app to another queue ( ). Send an HTTP post ( ). By default, the various scopes apply to all, i.e., all apps and constantly on. The scopes are: User ( ). Queue ( ). Cluster ( ). App ( ). Time ( ). Sustained Violation (This isn't shown in the AutoActions list). If you haven't defined a particular action or scope, that is, it's using the default, the glyph is gray ( ). When defined the glyph is blue in an active AutoAction ( ), and darkened for a disabled action ( ). Click the History of Runs for detailed information when the AutoAction was triggered. The history notes the time the action was triggered, contains a link a Cluster View (see below), and a link to the offending app. Hover over the app's link to see the app's type and click it to bring the app's APM. Click the run's Link button for the Cluster View ( Operations > Usage Details > Infrastructure ) for that particular run. The Cluster View shows a time slice, ±5 minutes from when the AutoAction was triggered and lists all the apps running during that period. This app table is similar to the app table shown under Applications > Applications . Not all the running apps will have triggered an AutoAction during the time slice. Click in the graph to show the apps running at that point in time. The Notifications column ( ) notes if the app triggered the AutoAction ( ), has tuning suggestions ( ), or both ( ). In the example below, two apps were running at the time; both triggered the action but neither has tuning suggestions. Hovering over brings up a pop-up listing the violations; in this example the first app violated two separate AutoActions. 'Snoozing' AutoActions AutoActions violations can become \"noisy\", i.e., an app continues to violate an AutoAction but the violation adds no new information. 'Snoozing' AutoActions helps you filter out noise by preventing automatic actions from repeating during a specified period, if and only if , it is the same violation context, and the action adds no further information to the violation.

Once the app has finished, the alerts are generated notifying users about policy violations that already occurred. Impala Hive-on-Tez Note : Before 4.5.0.7 no running Hive apps alerted in real-time. Running duration versus final duration inconsistency Unravel calculates and publishes internally the current duration for apps of the following types in real-time, that is, when in the running state. Upon the app completion Unravel receives the actual end time and performs the final duration calculation. This can lead to an inconsistency where the duration aggregated and published during the running state is greater than the duration published upon the app's completion. Workflow Missing AutoAction violation badge The badge isn't displayed for following app types. For example, in the cluster view above these apps don't display even when they have violated an AutoAction during the time period shown. Hive Workflow Running and failed Impala apps.

Move to Queue action for the following apps Hive Impala Workflow \"Cloud\" type setups Unravel for EMR and Unravel for HDInsight Kill and move actions for all types of apps. Rules that span multiple clusters. In multi-cluster configurations AutoActions doesn't differentiate between entities of each cluster and setting up a policy targets all monitored clusters. For instance, setting up a rule to target root queue causes it to be monitored on all clusters. Workaround: If the cluster ID is known isolate the policy for the cluster using policy options. Uses the internal Hadoop cluster ID instead of Unravel cluster ID\/name. You must obtain the internal cluster ID in order to specify a Hadoop cluster in the policy options section. It can be obtained from HDFS namenode, where it’s stored in {dfs.namenode.name.dir}\/current\/VERSION. In case of transport message protocol synchronization error, n exceptionally rare occasion AutoAction can be triggered up to 180 seconds after the violation occurs. No data loss is expected. Recent Events & Alerts shows the events across all clusters regardless of the currently selected cluster. Application Master level metrics, such as job metrics and job counters, aren't collected by EMR sensor by default and therefore cann't be used in AA policies. Collection of AM metrics can be enabled manually using “am-polling” option in EMR sensor. In exceptionally rare cases AutoActions can be triggered up to 180 seconds later in case of transport message protocol synchronization error but no data loss is expected. Prior to Unravel v4.5.2.0 Cloud Release, AutoActions aren't supported. All other Cloud platforms, for example, Unravel for Azure Databricks, Quoble, etc. There is no support for AutoActions.

"body" : "See here for limitations on auto actions. Whether using Create from Template or Build Rule you have five sections. Expert Rule is simply a text box. The sections are: Name and description The name is mandatory and is used by the UI for all auto actions' displays; we recommend using a name which reflects the auto action's purpose. The description is optional, but we recommend completing it with a succinct description of the action. When users hover over the action's name, the description is displayed. This example is from Create from Template . The name is already filled with the same name as the template and is highlighted. You can change the name. Ruleset At least one rule type ( User , Queue , Cluster , Apps , and Expert Rule ) must be defined. You can define rules for each rule type using pull down menus for a metric , type or state . The Expert Rule is available only in the Build Rule template. Metric defines a rule \"metric\" \"comparison operator\" \"value\". See Supported Cluster Metrics for a list and definition of available metrics . The comparison operators: >, >=, ==, <, and <=. Value: any valid numeric value. The default value is 0; were you to leave it the auto action would constantly trigger. The Type options are: MapReduce, YARN, Tez, Spark, Impala, Workflow and Hive The State options are: new, new_saving, submitted, accepted, scheduled, allocated, allocatedSaving, launched, running, finishing, finished, killed, failed, undefined, newAny, allocatedAny, pending, and * (all). Multiple rule types are evaluated in conjunction with each other using: Or , And , or Same Or and And work as you would expect. See Same Logical Operator for the definition of Same and its implementation. Using create from template This template has the Ruleset defined as needed to fulfill the template type, for example, Rogue Contention In Queues (allocated memory). The template highlights the fields you can or should change. You cann't delete\/add any of the rule types or add\/delete rules. You can change the metric , comparison , type , and state if available by using the pull down menus. If you change the Metric , Type , or State the template doesn'tperform the task you have selected, for example, Rogue Contention In Queues (allocated memory). The default value for the metric comparison is 0. You must change the value otherwise the auto action constantly triggers. Multiple rules types are Same'd together. See Same Logical Operator for its definition and implementation Using build rule The Ruleset initially lists the type of rules available, User , Queue, Cluster , App , or EXPERT RULE . Click the rule type you want to define. Below Add Queue is selected with the options to add rules for metric , type and state . These options and only these options, are available for every rule type except the Expert Rule template which is a text box. You must define at least one rule for each of the rule type selected. In the example below, Metric and Type are selected for the Queue rule type. You use the pull-down menus to select metric , the comparison operator , type , or state . See above for further information. A second rule , Apps has been added. When multiple rules are selected , you must choose how they are evaluated in conjunction with each other. The default is the Same operator, but you may select Or or And . See Same Logical Operator for the definition of Same and its implementation. Or and And work as you would expect . You can choose up to two rules, e.g., user & user, expert rule & queue, etc. Click Close to delete a rule type and click trash ( ) to delete a specific rule. If you close the rule before saving the auto actions, your settings are lost. Options Define the scope ( User , Queue , Cluster , and Application Name ), the period in which the auto action acts on a violation ( Time ), and how long\/short the violation must occur before the auto action takes action ( Sustained ). When you select an option its default is All, except Time which defaults to always and Sustained Violation which defaults to none. When using Create from Template the required option is already checked and uses the default. Any changes you make may cause the auto action to not perform as expected. As of 4.5.07 when using Create from Template the options sections lists only options that are available for the chosen template. For instance, the Rogue Impala templates only has Queue , Cluster , and Application Name options. Check the box next to the option's name to select it. You can narrow the scope of User , Queue , Cluster , and Application Name by using Only or Except . Only applies the rule to only those apps specified, while Except applies them to all but those specified . Use the Transform to specify the names using a regular expression. The example below is using the Application Name in the Except mode with the app MyApp. You can add more apps by clicking Add Application . Since no regular expression is specified, this option applies to all apps except MyApp. Create from Template defaults to All . The Time sets the time range and time zone during which the auto action can be triggered. The auto action remains active but doesn't trigger outside of the specified time range. The default start and end time is when you defined auto action with the time zone set to America\/Los Angeles. If you don't change the default time the auto action can be triggered for only one minute a day. Enter the time directly or click on the clock ( ) in the time box. Time is entered in 24 hour time. The end time must be later than the start time. Sustained violation specifies a length of time violation must occur before the auto action is triggered. This allows time for the violator to \"self correct\" and lowers the number of false positives The default is zero, i.e., all auto actions are immediately triggered upon violation and the specified action is carried out. You can select minimum or maximum mode. In both cases the auto action must be continually violated. Minimum sustained mode triggers the action only if this violation was continuously detected for at least the specified period. This suppresses triggering of violation actions for “on-offs” and metric spikes. These are normal in multi-tenant cluster environments can return to normal operation on their own. If a violation stops before the minimum time period, the clock is reset for that app. For instance, if the minimum time is one hour and the app violates the auto action for 58 minutes and then returns to normal – no action is taken and the time period for that app resets to 0. Maximum sustained mode triggers the action only if this violation is continuously detected for less than the specified time period. This suppresses the triggering of violations for long-running apps and triggers on auto action rule scope on ad hoc short-lived user apps. Actions Defines the actions to take when the auto action is triggered. As of 4.5.0.7 when using Create from Template the actions section lists only options that are available for the chosen template. For instance, Impala and Workflow templates don't have the option to Move the app or workflow. Build Rule and Create from Template , exception for Impala query, you can specify the following actions: Send an email , HTTP Post , Post to Slack , Move App to Queue , and Kill App . Use Build Rule to enter an Expert Action . See Expert Mode for information on defining an action in JSON. See Auto Actions and Pagerduty for using Unravel's API to receive notifications via Pagerduty. You can't kill a Hive, Impala, or Workflow app. You can choose one or more actions. Check the box to choose that action. If you chose no actions, the UI simply records the violation and saves the data for the cluster view. Shown below are all the possible actions; in Create from Template only actions valid for the template are available. For Send Email you must enter at least one recipient. Add more recipients by clicking Add Recipient . You can also specify to include the owner of the app selecting the Include Owner radio button. For HTTP post you must enter at least one URL. You can add more URLs by clicking Add URL . Post to Slack Unravel provides integration with SlackApp allowing you to post information to one or more Slack channels and users. In order to use this feature you need a Slack: Webhook URL : The incoming webhook URL configured in Slack for the channel or user. You can post to multiple webhooks. Token : The OAuth access token for the SlackApp. See Slack's Incoming Webhooks for further information on creating\/obtaining the above. 4.5.0.0 - 4.5.0.7 Prior to 4.5.0.7 Unravel uses the official Slack API available at https:\/\/slack.com\/api\/chat.postMessage . Using it, you can post simultaneously to: Public Slack channel Private channel Direct message\/IM channel It provides a better integration with Slack Service so you can send a direct message to the owner of Hadoop job's violating the Auto Action. You must generate the token via a Slack service website. For more information on generating the token see: test tokens - generic user icon and \"bot\" username custom bot user token - generic bot icon, with generic \"bot\" username Slack App user token with chat:write:bot - inherits Slack App's icon, with generic \"bot\" username Slack App bot user token - inherits Slack App's icon, with generic \"bot\" username Move app to queue or Kill App . You must enter a queue to move the App to. The Move App and Kill App are mutually exclusive. If you select both, the Kill App takes precedence and Move App ignored. In order for these to be executed the scope must: Have directly caused the rule violation, and Have allocated resources, that is the app is in allocated or running states. Move App is a non-destructive action that shouldn't affect the cluster performance and its availability to the user; however we suggest using it with caution. Kill App is a destructive action. It can affect the cluster performance and its availability to the users. This option is primarily to kill rogue apps that are causing contention of a cluster resources. Use Build Rule to enter an action using JSON. See Expert Rules for examples. " },

Using Expert Rule The AutoActions engine is capable of much more than is available through the templates. Expert Rule is a very powerful mode giving you total access the engine's capabilities. You can create complex rulesets, using JSON, to accommodate almost any cluster monitoring requirements. Before using this mode, you should have clear understanding of AutoActions concepts. See the Expert Rule section for a detailed explanation on how to define an AutoAction. See the Sample AutoActions section for examples of rules and actions. Click Save AutoAction .

"body" : "Overview Expert Rule is a very powerful mode of operation which provides you with greater flexibility than is available through the templates. Using the Expert Rule you can create complex rulesets to accommodate almost any cluster monitoring requirements. Before using this mode, you should have clear understanding of AutoActions concepts and capabilities, along with JSON, which is used to define the AutoAction. This mode's flexibility and power makes it dangerous and capable of wreaking havoc. Consult with the Unravel team before attempting to use the Expert Rule. Before using the Expert Rule, look at Build Rule to see if you can use that template. It lets you define an expert rule and action while giving you support by defining the header, and providing basic rulesets, options, and actions. See here for the current limitations on AutoActions. In this mode you must specify Prerequisite conditions : boolean conditions that must be met for the Unravel Server to evaluate the AutoAction's defining conditions, for example AutoAction should run from 8.00 and 14.00. Defining conditions : boolean conditions that must be met for the Unravel Server to execute the corresponding action, for example the app can't run more than 50 mapper tasks. Actions : steps to be taken when the prerequisite and defining conditions evaluate to true, for example send an email to admin. When using Expert Rule you must define the Header, Ruleset ( rules ), Options, and Actions ( actions ) using the JSON data format. {\n \/\/ header is required\n 'HEADER' \n\n \/\/ Rules - at least one must be defined. Two or must be joined using an operator.\n \"rules\":[\n { scope } | \"operator\" [ { scope } { scope } ... \n ]\n\n \/\/ Prerequisite Conditions - at least one\n 'OPTIONS - POLICY\/SCOPE'\n \n \/\/ Actions - at least one\n \"actions\":[\n { action } \n ]\n} Header : basic AutoAction information including status (in\/active). Rules : the rules for the scope. You must define at least one rule. Options - Policy\/Scope : who, what, where causes a violation and when. You must specify at least one. Actions : actions to perform when a violation triggers the AutoAction. If none are defined the UI still implements and tracks AutoActions. Defining your AutoAction Header You must define a header.

Removing state doesn't affect the rule. \"rules\":[\n {\n \"scope\":\"apps\",\n \"metric\":\"duration\",\n \"compare\":\">\",\n \"value\":10,\n \"state\":\"\",\n \"type\":\"workflow\"\n }\n] Violation occurs when the app has a duration > 10. Removing state and type doesn' affect the rule. \"rules\":[\n {\n \"scope\":\"apps\",\n \"metric\":\"duration\",\n \"compare\":\">\",\n \"value\":10,\n \"state\":\"\",\n \"type\":\"\"\n }\n] A Rule Array Two or more rules combined with an operator. \"rules\": [\n {\n \"operator\": [\n \/\/ rule 1\n {\n\n }\n \/\/ rule 2\n {\n }\n \/\/ rule n\n {\n }\n ]\n }\n]\n\n Note Multi_X is equivalent to the plural of X.

OR : the AutoAction is triggered if one or more of conditions is true. AND : the AutoAction is triggered if all the conditions are true. SAME : the AutoAction is triggered if all the conditions are true within a specific scope. Options - policy\/scope: prerequisite conditions Who\/what can cause the violation and when.

Below are two actions with invalid information. In send_mail the addresses are invalid and the owner isn't to be notified. The http_post has an invalid URL. Unravel AutoAction's engine sends the email and tries to perform the HTTP post; however both actions will fail. Since only these two actions are specified, no action is effectively taken.

Note You must take care when entering information. A specified action fails if you enter the incorrect information, for example bad email address\/URL\/channel, wrong or non-existent queue. Send_email Unlike when using Create from Template or Build Rule , the UI won't notify you when entering an invalid address on the face of it, for example myMailaddress&com.

Example - a rule designed to alert on rogue users. Human-readable form If any user is running more than ten jobs on a cluster and the same user has more than five jobs pending then report the user as rogue.

AutoActions runs all metric aggregations simultaneously. When the metrics are received and aggregated it then evaluates all rules and expressions. It starts at the evaluation tree's leaf expressions and works its way up to the root expression. Assume the above rule, three users (A, B, and C), and the following conditions user A has 12 running and three pending apps user B has seven running and one pending apps user C has 21 running and 11 pending apps First, the two (2) simple rules are evaluated: does user have more than 10 apps running? User A has 12 → TRUE User B has seven → FALSE User C has 21 → TRUE does user have more than 5 apps pending? User A has three → FALSE User B has one → FALSE User C has 11 → TRUE Second, it applies clustering by scope and for each cluster it counts the number rules triggered. In the back-end code this procedure is called “linking” of rules (see Ruleset.java). Cluster “User A”, link count = 1. User A > 10 running apps? → TRUE User A > five pending apps? → FALSE Cluster “User B”, link count = 0. User B > 10 running apps? → FALSE User B > five pending apps? → FALSE Cluster “User C”, link count = 2. User C > 10 running apps? → TRUE User C > five pending apps? → TRUE Third, all groups with less than the needed number of links (2 in this case) are discarded. If some of the rules were triggered, that rule is reset for the group. Cluster “User A” has a link count = 1 so it's reset and discarded. User A > 10 running apps? → TRUE reset to FALSE User A > 5 pending apps? → FALSE Cluster “User B”, link count = 0 so it's discarded. User B > 10 running apps? → FALSE User B > 5 pending apps? → FALSE Finally, only the users that have triggered all rules remain. Cluster “User C”, link count = 2: User C > 10 running apps? → TRUE User C > 5 pending apps? → TRUE User C meets the criteria for the Rogue User AutoAction, therefore User C triggers the AutoAction and the alert is sent and\/or the actions performed. Comparison to AND Both User A and User C would have triggered the above rule were AND used instead of SAME , that is, ( any user has > 10 running apps) AND ( any user has > 5 pending jobs). To achieve the same result as the above example using AND instead of SAME , you would need to create the following AutoAction rule for each and every user on the cluster: ( Username has > 10 running apps) AND ( Username has > 5 pending apps) " },

"body" : "The snooze function prevents automatic actions from being repeated during a specified period, if and only if, it is the same violation context and the action adds no further information to the violation, i.e., essentially noise. For example, alerts of user A violating rule Y are snoozed as the alert adds no new context the user A's violation. App is used in this example, but the AutoAction can be defined for user, queues, etc. An AutoAction specifying a Kill App or Move App action can not be snoozed. Snooze is set the first time the app violates the rule. The AutoAction itself continues to run uninterrupted whether zero or all apps currently covered by the AutoAction are snoozed.

Predefined templates cover a variety of jobs, yet they can lack the specificity or complexity you need for monitoring. For instance, you can use the Rogue Application template to determine if jobs are using too much memory or vCore resources by alerting for jobs using more than 1 TB of memory. However, if you only want to know if only Map Reduce jobs are using > 1 TB, the template won't suffice. For such instances, you need to write your AutoActions using the Expert Mode template with the rules and some actions written in JSON. Below are a variety of AutoActions written using JSON. MapReduce Alert on MapReduce jobs using > 1 TB of memory. {\n \"scope\": \"multi_app\",\n \"type\": \"MAPREDUCE\",\n \"metric\": \"allocated_mb\",\n \"compare\": \">\",\n \"value\": 1073741824\n}\n Alert on MapReduce jobs using > 1000 vCores. {\n \"scope\": \"multi_app\",\n \"type\": \"MAPREDUCE\",\n \"metric\": \"allocated_vcores\",\n \"compare\": \">\",\n \"value\": 1000\n}\n Alert on MapReduce jobs running more than 1 hour. {\n \"scope\": \"multi_app\",\n \"type\": \"MAPREDUCE\",\n \"metric\": \"elapsed_time\",\n \"compare\": \">\",\n \"value\": 3600000\n} Alert on MapReduce jobs that may affect any production SLA jobs running on a cluster. Check for MapReduce jobs not in the SLA queue, running between 12 am and 3 am, and using > 1 TB of memory. Use the JSON rule specifying Map Reduce jobs using > 1 TB and set the rule conditions as shown. Alert on ad hoc MapReduce jobs use a majority of cluster resources which may impact the cluster performance. Check for MapReduce Jobs in the “root.adhocd” queue, running between 1 am and 5 am, and using > 1 TB of memory. Use the JSON rule specifying Map Reduce jobs using > 1 TB and set the rule conditions as shown. Spark The JSON rules to alert if a Spark app is grabbing majority of cluster resources are exactly like the Map Reduce rules for except SPARK is used for the \"type\". Alert on only Spark jobs using > 1 TB of memory. {\n \"scope\": \"multi_app\",\n \"type\": \"SPARK\",\n \"metric\": \"allocated_mb\",\n \"compare\": \">\",\n \"value\": 1073741824\n}\n Alert on only Spark jobs using > 1000 vCores. {\n \"scope\": \"multi_app\",\n \"type\": \"MAPREDUCE\",\n \"metric\": \"allocated_vcores\",\n \"compare\": \">\",\n \"value\": 1000\n}\n Alert if a Spark SQL query has unbalanced input vs output, which may indicate inefficient or “rogue” queries.

Check for any user where the allocated vCores aggregated over all their apps is > 1000. You can use the Rouge User template, or the JSON rule. {\n \"scope\": \"multi_user\",\n \"metric\": \"allocated_vcores\",\n \"compare\": \">\",\n \"value\": 1000\n} Check for any user where the allocated memory aggregated over all their apps is > 1 TB.

If any other queue needs resources, it can preempt apps in the quarantine queue. Moving rogue apps to quarantine queue frees resources for other apps. Below we are alerting on vCores; to alert on memory just substitute memory for vCores in the following rules. Alert for rogue app If any app (not SLA bound) is consuming more than certain vCores at midnight, move it to a quarantine queue. You can use the Rogue Application template to specify vCores. Or the Expert Mode template and set JSON rule for vCores as {\n \"scope\": \"multi_app\",\n \"metric\": \"allocated_vcores\",\n \"compare\": \">\",\n \"value\": 1000\n} Set Time rule condition as: Set Move app rule as: Any app needing greater than X amount of resources has to be approved, otherwise the app is moved to quarantine queue. You can use the Rogue Application template to specify vCores. Or use the Expert Mode template and set JSON rule as for vCores {\n \"scope\": \"multi_app\",\n \"metric\": \"allocated_vcores\",\n \"compare\": \">\",\n \"value\": [X]\n} Set Queue rule conditions. Set Move app queue action. Related articles Running AutoAction Demos " },

Text indicates where you must substitute your particular values for the text. demo-path is the complete path of the auto-actions-demos directory. Unpack and install the AutoAction demos Put the auto-actions-demos.tgz file in the directory Unravel Server host machine where you want to unpack it. Navigate to the directory and unpack the demos. # tar -xvzf auto-actions-demo.tgz Tar creates and unpacks the files into auto-actions-demos directory. The directory should contain the following files. # ls auto-actions-demos\ndemos\/ setup\/ Go to demo-path \/ setup directory. Open .\/settings file and enter the email address to receive violation notifications. Execute the .\/setup-all script. # .\/setup-all The AutoAction rules that include time specification are automatically adjusted to the current time period, for example, from CURRENT_HOUR:00 to CURRENT_HOUR+2:00. After running the script go the Unravel Server UI and select Manage | Auto Actions tab. You should see all the AutoAction demos listed under Active Auto Actions. Each AutoAction is entitled AA-tag , for example, AA-Spark-1c , Map-1b . Executing the demos Go to demo-path \/ demos directory. For each AutoActions rules listed in Manage | Auto Actions there is a corresponding script in the demo's directory. Each script triggers the corresponding AutoAction demo. For example, in the UI the AutoAction named AA-Spark-1c is listed. The corresponding triggering script file is demo-Spark-1c . You should see the following files in the demos directory. # cd demo-path \/setup \n# ls\ndemo-Hive-1a demo-MR-1a demo-MR-2b demo-Spark-1b\ndemo-Hive-2a demo-MR-1b demo-MR-3a demo-Spark-1c\ndemo-Hive-2b demo-MR-1c demo-MR-3b run-all-demos\ndemo-Hive-3a demo-MR-2a demo-Spark-1a scripts\/ Execute .\/demo-tag script to trigger the corresponding AA-tag rule. Each script is designed to simulate violation conditions for the corresponding AutoAction on the target Hadoop cluster, for example, to trigger AA-Spark-1c you run the demo-Spark-1c script. Some AutoAction's demo scripts trigger multiple AutoActions. This side effect can happen when running your own defined AutoActions due to AutoActions having overlapping definitions. Cleaning up demos Run .\/clean-all script remove all the demo AutoAction from the Unravel Server.

You can then help developers remediate a app's issue and simultaneously improve your cluster's health. One of the unique aspects of Unravel is its insights into an app's run and the recommendations it provides to improve an app's efficiency. Unravel's architecture deploys sensors that are hooked into running YARN container JVMs. These sensors capture actual memory usage which you can then compare to the amount of YARN memory allocated by developers, (memory allocation per YARN) x (number of YARN containers). For a given app, we can see JVM memory consumption on the Resource tab in the apps APM. Select the metric VmRss (Virtual memory resident set size) for this information. For Spark apps, in the following example, these time series could be compared against spark.executor.memory and spark.driver.memory . Operations > Dashboard contains a list of Inefficient Applications , if any. The list is filtered by App type and then the type of inefficiency ( Event Name ). This information is also available by a Rest API. (See \/apps\/events\/inefficient_apps for an example.) Select the tab for the app type you want to examine and a list of every event ( Event Name ) apps of that type have experienced. The number of apps experiencing the event is also listed. The table is sorted in descending order on # of App Found column. Click the event type you are interested in. A table of all the apps that experienced the event is displayed. The event type is noted in the upper left-hand corner. In this example, UnderutilizedNodeMemoryEvent was selected. This indicates a low utilization of memory resources by the apps. Unravel notes when it has tuning suggestions for the app by a glyph. Sort the list of this column to see all the apps that have recommendations. Click the app to bring up its APM. Although you are examining an app based on the event you selected, an app can have multiple events. In this case the app has four events and four recommendations. Click the event box to see Unravel's recommendation and where the app used resources inefficiently. The Recommendations tab just lists the recommendations for quick access. The Efficiency tab lists all the events the app experienced and the recommendations, if any, for the event. For the following app, Unravel recommends adjusting the spark.executor.memory , spark.default.parallelism , spark.yarn.executor.memoryOverhead , and spark.executor.instance properties. The developer can implement these recommendations as --conf arguments when using the spark-submit command. Each app type has events specific to the app type, and the recommendations are implemented based upon the app type. " },

"body" : "Running real-time data injection and multiple concurrent workloads on HBase clusters in production are always challenging. There are multiple factors that affect a cluster's performance or health and dealing with them isn't easy. Timely, up-to-date and detailed data is crucial to locating and fixing issues to maintain a cluster's health and performance. Most cluster managers provide high level metrics, which while helpful, aren't enough for understanding cluster and performance issues. Unravel provides detailed data and metrics to help you identify the root causes of cluster and performance issues specifically hot-spotting. This tutorial examines how you can use Unravel's HBase's (APM) to debug issues in your HBase cluster and improve its performance. Cluster health Unravel provides cluster metrics per cluster which provide an overview of HBase clusters in the Operations > Usage Details > HBase tab where all the HBase clusters are listed. Click a cluster name to bring up the cluster's detailed information. The metrics are color coded so you can quickly ascertain your cluster's health and what, if any, issues you need to drill into. Green = Healthy Red = Unhealthy, alert for metrics and investigation required In this case, we examine the HBase metrics and to help youunderstand how use them to monitor your HBase cluster through Unravel. Overall cluster activity Live Region Servers : the number of running region servers. Dead Region Servers : the number of dead region servers. Cluster Requests : the number of read and write requests aggregated across the entire cluster. Average Load : the average number of regions per region server across all Servers Rit Count : the number of regions in transition. RitOver Threshold : the number of regions that have been in transition longer than a threshold time (default: 60 seconds). RitOldestAge : the age, in milliseconds, of the longest region in transition. Region Server refers to the servers (hosts) while region refers to the specific regions on the servers. Dead Region Servers This metric gives you insight into the health of the region servers . In a healthy cluster this should be zero. When the number of dead region servers is one or greater you know something is wrong in the cluster. Dead region servers can cause an imbalance in the cluster. When the server has stopped its regions are then distributed across the running region servers . This consolidation means some region servers handle a larger number of regions and consequently have a corresponding higher number of read, write and store operations. This can result in some servers processing a huge number of operations and while others are idle, causing hot-spotting. Average Load This metric is the average number of regions on each region server . Like Dead Region Servers , this metric helps you to triage imbalances on cluster and optimize the cluster's performance. Below, for the same cluster, you can see the impact on the Average Load when Dead Region Servers is 0 and 4. Dead Region Servers=0 In this case, the Average Load is 2k. Dead Region Servers=4 As the number increased so did the corresponding Average Load which is now 3.23k, an increase of 60%, The next section of the tab contains a region server table which shows the number of regions hosted by the region server . You can see the delta (Average Load - Region Count); a large delta generates an imbalance in cluster and reduces the cluster's performance. You can resolve this issue by either: Moving the regions onto other region servers . Removing regions from a current region server at which point the master immediately deploys it on another available region server . Region server Unravel provides a list of region servers , their metrics and Unravel's insight into server's health for all region servers across the cluster for a specific point of time. For each region server the table lists the Region Server Name and the server metrics Read Request Count , Write Request Count , Store File Size , Percent Files Local , Compaction Queue Length , Region Count , and Health for each server. These metrics and health status are helpful in monitoring activity in your HBase cluster The Health status is color coded and you can see at a glance when the server is in trouble. Hover over the server's health status to see a tool tip listing the hot-spotting notifications with their associated threshold (Average value * 1.2). If any value is above the threshold the region server is hot-spotting and Unravel shows the health as bad. Region server metric graphs Beneath the table are four graphs readRequestCount , writeRequestCount , storeFileSize , and percentFilesLocal . These graphs are for all metrics across the entire cluster. The time period the metrics are graphs over is noted above the graphs. Tables The last item in the Cluster tab is a list of tables. This list is for all the tables across all the region servers across the entire cluster. Unravel then uses these metrics to attempt to detect an imbalance. Averages are calculated within each category and alerts are raised accordingly. Just like with the region servers you can tell at glance the Health of the table. The list is searchable and displays the Table Name , Table Size , Region Count , Average Region Size , Store File Size , Read Request Count , Write Request Count , and finally Health . Hover over the health status to see a tool tip listing the hot-spotting. Bad health indicates that a large amount of store operations from different sources are redirected to this table. In this example, the Store File Size is more than 20% of the threshold. You can use this list to drill down into the tables, and get its details which can be useful to monitor your cluster. Click a table to view its details, which include graphs of metrics over time for the region, a list of the regions using the table, and the apps accessing the table. The following is an example of the graphed metrics, regionCount , readRequestCount , and writeRequestCount . Region Once in the Table view, click the Region tab to see the list of regions accessing the table. The table list shows the Region Name , Region Server Name , and the region metrics Store File Size , Read Request Count , Write Request Count , and Health . These metrics are useful in gauging activity and load in region. The region health is important in deciding whether the region is functioning properly. In case any metric value is crossing the threshold, the status is listed as bad. A bad status indicates you should start investigating to locate and fix hot-spotting. " },

"body" : "It can be difficult to understand what is happening in your Kafka cluster and to successfully root cause\/troubleshoot problems. In order to help you do this, Unravel provides insights and visibility throughout all levels of your cluster. This includes the ability to drill down into apps acting as consumers processing data streams. Unravel's Kafka monitoring and insights are built-in; no configuration is required once you have connected Unravel to your Kafka cluster., In th following examples are some of the best practices for using Unravel to monitor your Kafka environments. It is assumed you have basic knowledge of Kafka concepts and architecture. Your starting point in Unravel is Operations > Usage Details > Kafka . It displays the overall health of the cluster and provides immediate access to your cluster's brokers and topics. Unravel provides six cluster wide KPIs to give you an immediate view of the Kafka cluster's overall health and IO. The first three KPIs provide information on your clusters' partitions and controllers. They are color coded so you can quickly ascertain their health. Green = Healthy Red = Unhealthy, alert for metrics and investigation required The next three KPIs are data IO metrics and are always blue. Beneath the KPIs are three tabs, Metrics , Broker , and Topic . The Metrics and Broker tabs have the same graphs but contain different data, cluster wide and broker specific data respectively. These KPIs and the data graphs help you root cause existing problems or identify potential issues. Immediate access to your cluster's brokers and topics allow you to quickly drill down and locate the problematic areas. Below we examine a few scenarios. Under replicated partitions A healthy cluster has no under replicated partitions. If this KPI is greater than zero, your replication isn't occurring as fast as configured. This under replication: Adds latency as consumers don't receive their needed data until messages are replicated. Suggests you are more vulnerable to data loss if you have a master failure. If you have under replicated partitions, it typically points to a problem with one or more brokers. You should root cause the problem immediately to avoid any data loss. First, you need to understand how often the under replication is occurring. Scroll down in the Metrics tab to locate the Under Replicated Partitions graph to see the under replication over time across the cluster. When you see current or consistent under replication drill down into the brokers. Click the Broker tab for the list of brokers and their KPIs. Brokers having problems will have 1 or greater listed in Under Replicated Partitions column. Click each broker with under replicated partitions and scroll down to its Under Replicated Partitions graph. Once you have identified the problem brokers, examine each of their logs to determine the root cause. Offline partitions This KPI is the total number of offline topic partitions. A healthy cluster doesn't have any offline partitions. Offline partitions can occur if: The brokers with replicas are down. Unclean leader election is disabled and the replicas aren't in sync. In this case, none can be elected leader. (This may be desirable to ensure no messages are lost.) When you have offline partitions you should immediately root cause the problem. Scroll down in the Metrics tab to locate the # Offline Partition Count graph and examine the offline partition number over time. If you have currently have offline partitions, drill down into the brokers. Click the Broker , and check Offline Partitions Count for each broker. Click each broker with offline partitions and examine its # Offline Partition Count graph. It graphs the number of offline partitions over time and you can see whether the partition is currently offline, were briefly offline, or were offline for an extended period of time. After identifying the problem brokers, examine each broker's log to determine the cause of the problem. Topic partition strategy This section provides best practices for using Unravel to evaluate your topic\/broker performance. A common challenge is providing an architecture for the topics and partitions in your cluster which can, and will, support the data velocity coming from producers. Typically, adjustments have tended to be a \"shot in the dark\" because of a lack of relevant data. Unravel provides detailed information to shed light on how your architecture is performing, which, in turn, can help you to re-configure your architecture for better performance. Producer architecture It can be a challenge in deciding how to partition topics on the Kafka level. Producers can choose to send messages via key or use a round-robin strategy when no key has been defined for a message. Choosing the correct number of partitions for your data velocity is important to ensure you have a real-time architecture that is performant. You can use Unravel to get a better understanding on how your current architecture is performing. Then, use the insights to guide you in choosing the number of partitions. Click the Topic tab and scroll down for the list of topics in your cluster. You can quickly identify topics with heavy traffic and where you should examine your partitions' performance. For topics that are experiencing heavy traffic or are in trouble, click its consumer. You can then see the consumer's topic list and the health of each topic. Use this information to help you determine the correct number of partitions. Consumer group architecture You can make changes on the consumer group side to scale according to your topic\/partition architecture. Unravel provides a convenient view for each topic's consumer groups so you can quickly see the health status of each consumer group in your cluster. When the consumer group is a Spark Streaming app Unravel can provide insights for it, thereby providing an end-to-end monitoring solution for your streaming apps. See Kafka Insights for a use case on monitoring consumer groups, and lagging\/stalled partitions or consumer groups.

The longer it takes to flush the log to disk, the more the pipeline backs up and the worse the latency and throughput. When latency goes up, even as small an increment as 10ms, end-to-end latency balloons which can lead to under replicated partitions The Log Flush Latency, 99th Percentile graph lets you keep track of the cluster's latency. At any given point in time 99% of the log latency is less than this value. Scroll down in the Metrics tab to see the cluster's log latency graph. If the latency is fluctuating dramatically, or is consistently high, you need to identify the broker that are contributing to it. Click the Broker tab so you can examine individual brokers. Unlike under replicated partitions, the broker table doesn't include a log flush latency KPI. You must examine each broker individually. Click each broker and then scroll down to its Log Flush Latency, 99th Percentile graph. Problematic brokers have latency graphs with dramatic fluctuations or consistently high latency. After identifying these brokers, examine their logs to gain insight into the problem. If your cluster can keep up with the amount of data coming in, consider adding more brokers. Another possibility is that the node is \"bad\", e.g., the hard drive is going bad; if that is the case you should swap the node out for a healthy one. Regularly monitoring this graph can help you see trends which could lead to problems. " },

If this only persists for about a minute, it likely means the active controller switched from one broker to another. If this persists for longer, troubleshoot the cluster for \"split brain\". The # Active Controller Trend graphs all brokers and their status as the active controller. You can swiftly see where your cluster has problems.

"body" : "Overview The Unravel Intelligence engine provides insights into a cluster's activities through the status of the Consumer Group's (CG). A CG's state is determined on a partition by partition basis, specifically by its commit offset relative to the producer's log commit offset for a particular partition. The states are: OK : commit offset is in pace with the log end offset. Lagging : the Consumer is lagging behind the Producer. Both the consumer's and log commit offsets are increasing, but the Producer’s is increasing faster. When graphed over time, the Producer's slope is increasing faster than the consumer's slope. Stalled : the Consumer has essentially stopped while the Producer is still active. The consumer's offset isn't increasing while the log commit offset is increasing. Graphically, the slope of the consumer is essentially zero. A Topic's status is set to the lowest status among its Consumer Groups and a Consumer Group's status is set to the lowest status among its partitions. You must drill down from the Cluster in order to determine where Topic\/Consumer Group is lagging or stalled. Use case example Go to Operation | Charts | Kafka to view your currently configured clusters. Click a cluster name to bring up the Cluster View. Use the graph scroll-bar to view graphs of the cluster metrics. The Topic table lists all topics with their consumers and the topic's status. Click within a graph to see what topics were available at that point in time. Click the topic name to examine it. In this case, topic test2 is stalled and has two consumers, demo and test-consumer-group . Consumers with the same name are grouped together into one consumer group. Choosing all clusters from the pull down menu creates tabs for all your clusters so you can easily switch between them. The Topic view opens with Topic Detail tab displaying the brokers KPIs. The Consumer Details table lists active Consumers with its status for that point in time. Its KPIs are across all partitions. Click the graph to see what Consumers were running at that point in time. Here test2 only has one stalled consumer demo ; in turn, demo has one stalled and three lagging partitions. Click the Partition Detail tab to view the Consumer's information per partition. The Consumer Details table now lists the KPIs and status for all consumer groups on the partition displayed. Click within the graph to see what Consumers were running at that point in time on that partition. Partition 0 is initially displayed using the metric offset . As expected from the preceding graph the test-consumer-group is OK on this partition, while demo is lagging. Use the Partition and Metric pull down menu to change partition to display and metric ( Offset or Consumer Lag ) to use. Click more info glyph ( ) in the Go To column to bring up the Consumer Group View. Here Partition 1 idgraphed on the metric Consumer Lag . It's obvious this is a stalled partition both from the steep slope and the status icon. The test-consumer-group is basically a flat-line. The CG view lists the Topics which it is consuming and opens with graphs of its broker KPIs. Just as a Topic can have multiple consumers with varying states, a Consumer Group can be consuming multiple topics with varying degrees of success. In this case, there is only one Topic being consumed and the CG is stalled. Click the Partition Detail tab to see partition. The Partition Details table lists the partitions with its KPIs and status . The window defaults to the graph of partition 0 using the offset metric. In the following image we see partition 1 is stalled, while 0, 2, 3 are lagging. Use the pull down menus to change Metric or Partition used for the graph. The denotes the partition displayed.

"body" : "In Spark, it is very important that the RDD partitions are aligned with the number of available tasks. Spark assigns one task per partition and each core can process one task at a time. By default, the number of partitions is set to the total number of cores on all the nodes hosting executors. Too few partitions leads to less concurrency, processing skew, and improper resource utilization. Too many partitions leads to low throughput and high task scheduling overhead. Tuning a Spark app You need to identify the stages that represent the bottlenecks during the execution. This can easily be done using Unravel's Spark Application Performance Manager (APM). Bring up your app in the Spark APM and select the Gannt Chart tab. Locate the job with the longest duration; click on it to bring the job up in the Spark Job APM. Now locate and click on the stage with the longest duration. The Spark job above took 3 hours 53-minutes to complete with the longest stage taking 43 minutes. This is the stage to examine. Clicking on the stage brings up its information. Click the Timeline tab to show the duration and I\/O of each task. The histogram charts allow you to quickly identify outlier tasks. In this case, there were 200 tasks; 199 tasks took approximately 5-minutes to complete and one approximately 35-40 minutes. This one task accounts for over 82% of the time the stage took to complete. To see the timelines for the first bucket (199 tasks), select it and then the Timeline tab under the histogram. This view shows an understandable view of the skew. In this example, you can see many executors are sitting idle as they wait for the outlier task to complete. Select the outlier bucket and the Timeline tab updates to display the information for this task. In this case the duration of the associated executor is almost equal to the duration of the entire app. The Spark APM's Graphs > Containers graph shows the bursting of containers when the longer executor started. Adding more partitions via repartition() can help distribute the data set among the executors and decrease the skew. Unravel might provide recommendations for optimizations in some cases where the join key or group by key are skewed. In this case, Unravel had three recommendations to improve the app's efficiency. Example In this Spark SQL example two dummy data sources are used, both of which are partitioned. The join operation between customer and order table is on cust_id column which is heavily skewed. Examining the code shows the key, 1000 , has the most number of entries in the orders table. Therefore, one of the reduce partitions contains all the 1000 entries. In such cases there are techniques which can help to avoid skewed processing. Increasing the spark.sql.autoBroadcastJoinThreshold value enables the smaller table “customer” to get broadcasted. Ensuring sufficient driver memory should address this problem. If memory in executors is sufficient, then decreasing the spark.sql.shuffle.partitions to accommodate more data per reduce partitions can help. This helps all the reduce tasks to have approximately the same duration. If possible find out the keys which are skewed and process them separately by using filters. Example: Decrease the spark.sql.shuffle.partitions to accommodate more data per reduce partitions. (Technique #2.) In this example, the spark.sql.shuffle.partitions default is 200. Here, there is lone task which takes more time during shuffle. That means the next stage can’t be started and executors are lying idle. Now change the spark.sql.shuffle.partitions to ten (10). As the shuffle input\/output is well within executor memory sizes, we can safely make this change. import org.apache.spark.sql.SparkSession\n\nobject SkewedDataframeTest {\n\n val INVALID_USAGE =\n s\"\"\"\n |Please enter all cmd line parameters!\n |\n |<numElements> valid numbers are 1 to any positive integer.\n |<skewPercent> valid numbers between 1 to 99\n \"\"\".stripMargin\n\n def main(args: Array[String]) = {\n\n if (args.length < 2) {\n println(INVALID_USAGE)\n System.exit(-1)\n }\n\n val numElements = args(0).toInt\n val skewPercent = args(1).toFloat\n\n val spark = SparkSession.builder().\n enableHiveSupport().getOrCreate()\n\n import spark.implicits._\n\n val numSkewedKeys = (numElements * (skewPercent \/ 100)).toInt\n val numCustomers = numElements \/ 100\n \/\/ Dummy data source which is partitioned\n val df3 = spark.sparkContext.parallelize(0 to numElements, 16).map(i => {\n val join_column = if (i < numSkewedKeys) 1000 else i % 999\n (i, join_column)\n }).toDF(\"order_no\", \"cust_id\").\n repartition(16, $\"order_no\")\n\n df3.createOrReplaceGlobalTempView(\"orders\")\n\n \/\/ Dummy data source which is partitioned\n val df4 = spark.sparkContext.parallelize(0 to numCustomers, 32).\n map(i => (i, i.toString)).\n toDF(\"cust_id\", \"name\").\n repartition(32, $\"cust_id\")\n\n df4.createOrReplaceGlobalTempView(\"customer\")\n\n spark.sql(\"select t1.name, COUNT( t2.order_no) \" +\n \"from global_temp.customer t1, global_temp.orders t2\" +\n \" where t1.cust_id=t2.cust_id \" +\n \" group by t1.name \" +\n \" having COUNT( t2.order_no) >= 50000\").show\n }\n\n} Real-life deployments In product deployments not all skew problems can be solved by configurations and repartitioning. If the data source itself is skewed, then tasks which read from these sources can’t be optimized; modifying the underlying data layout can help. Sometimes, at enterprise level, modification isn't possible as the data source is used from different tools and pipelines. " },

"body" : "Identifying issues in distributed apps like a Spark streaming app isn't trivial. Unravel helps you connect the dots across streaming apps to identify bottlenecks. Spark streaming is widely used in real-time data processing, especially with Apache Kafka. A typical scenario involves a Kafka producer app writing to a Kafka topic. The Spark app then subscribes to the topic and consumes records. The records might be further processed downstream using operations like map and foreachRDD ops or saved into a datastore. The following two scenarios illustrate how you can use Unravel’s APMs to inspect, understand, correlate, and finally debug issues around a Spark streaming app consuming a Kafka topic. They demonstrate how Unravel's APMs can help you perform an end-to-end analysis of the data pipelines and its apps. In turn, this wealth of information helps you effectively and efficiently debug and resolve issues that otherwise would require more time and effort. Producer failing scenario Consider a running Spark app that hasn't processed any data for a significant amount of time. The app's previous iterations successfully processed data and you know for a certainty that current iteration should be processing data. When you notice the Spark app has been running without processing any data, you want to check the app's I\/O. Click it to bring up the app and see its I\/O KPI. When you see the Spark app is consuming from Kafka, you need to examine Kafka side of the process to determine the issue. Click a batch to find the topic it is consuming. Bring up the Kafka Topic details which graphs the Bytes In Per Second , Bytes Out Per Second , Messages In Per Second , and Total Fetch Requests Per Second . In this case, you see Bytes In Per Second and Messages In Per Second graphs show a steep decline; this indicates the Kafka Topic is no longer producing any data. The Spark app isn't consuming data because there is no data in the pipeline to consume. You should notify the owner of the app that writes to this particular topic. Upon notification, they can drill down to determine and then resolve the underlying issues causing that writes to this topic to fail. ‘Slow’ Spark app and offline partitions in the Kafka cluster In this scenario, an app's run has processed significantly less data when compared to what is the expected norm. In the above scenario, the analysis was fairly straightforward. In these types of cases, the underlying root cause might be far more subtle to identify. The Unravel APM can help you to quickly and efficiently root cause such issues. When you see a considerable difference in the data processed by consecutive runs of a Spark App, bring up the APMs for each app. Examine the trend lines to identify a time window when there is a drop in input records for the slow app. The image, the slow app, shows a drop off in consumption. Drill down into the slow app's stream graph to narrow the time period (window) in which the I\/O dropped off. Unravel displays the batches that were running during the problematic time period. Inspect the time interval to see the batches' activity. In this example no input records were processed during the suspect interval. You can dig further into the issue by selecting a batch and examining it's input tab. In the following case, you can infer that no new offsets have been read based upon the Input Source 's Description ,“Offsets 1343963 to Offset 1343963”. You can further debug the problem on the Kafka side by viewing the Kafka cluster monitor. Navigate to Operations > Usage Details > Kafka . At a glance, the cluster's KPIs convey important and pertinent information. Here, the first two metrics show that the cluster is facing issues which need to be resolved as quickly as possible. # of Under Replicated Partitions is a broker level metric of the count of partitions for which the broker is the leader replica and the follower replicas that have yet not caught up. In this case there are 131 under replicated partitions. # of offline partitions is a broker level metric provided by the cluster's controlling broker. It is a count of the partitions that currently have no leader. Such partitions aren't available for producing\/consumption. In this case there are two offline partitions. You can select the Broker tab to see broker table. Here the table hints that the broker, Ignite1.kafka2 is facing some issue; therefore, the broker's status should be checked. Broker Ignite1.kafka2 has two offline partitions. The broker table shows that it is\/was the controller for the cluster. We could have inferred this because only the controller can have offline partitions. Examining the table further, we see that Ignite.kafka1 also has an active controller of one. The Kafka KPI # of Controller lists the Active Controller as one which should indicate a healthy cluster. The fact that there are two brokers listed as being one active controller indicates the cluster is in an inconsistent state. You can further corroborate the hypothesis by checking the status of the consumer group for the Kafka topic the Spark App is consuming from. In this example, consumer groups' status indicates it's currently stalled. The topic the stalled group is consuming is tweetSentiment-1000 . To drill down into the consumer groups topic, click the TOPIC tab in the Kafka Cluster manager and search for the topic. In this case, the topic's trend lines for the time range the Spark app's consumption dropped off show a sharp decrease in the Bytes In Per Second and Bytes Out Per Second . This decrease explains why the Spark app isn't processing any records. To view the consumer groups lag and offset consumption trends, click the consumer groups listed for the topic. In this example, the topic's consumer groups, stream-consumer-for-tweetSentimet1000 , log end offset trend line is a constant (flat) line that shows no new offsets have been consumed with the passage of time. This further supports our hypothesis that something is wrong with the Kafka cluster and especially broker Ignite.kafka2 . These are but two examples of how Unravel helps you to identify, analyze, and debug Spark Streaming apps consuming from Kafka topics. Unravel's APMs collates, consolidates, and correlates information from various stages in the data pipeline (Spark and Kafka), thereby allowing you to troubleshoot apps without ever having to leave Unravel.

"body" : "Due to Spark’s lazy evaluation model, there are often cases where a Spark app recomputes the same RDD several times during the lifetime of the app. Spark provides a facility cache() , which when inserted into your code, caches RDDs in executor memory. This can result in improving performance and decreasing overall execution time, especially when a given RDD is re-computed multiple times over the app's lifetime. Unravel's insights and recommendations tells you when you can take advantage of cache() to improve your app's performance. Above is an example, where Unravel is recommending RDD caching. But, more than that, Unravel also recommends where you should insert cache() into your code. In this case, Unravel recommends inserting it before line 102. The Spark APM than can show you the context of where in the code you should place it. Unravel Insights makes it easy for you to understand where and when to use cache() in order to improve your app's performance. This is just one of the events (insights) that Unravel’s ML-driven approach generates to help you tune your Spark apps. See our other use cases for further examples of how Unravel can save you a challenging and time consuming analysis with its it insights and recommendations to improve your app's performance. " },

"body" : "Informatica Big Data Management (BDM) suite enables enterprises to deploy advanced data management capabilities, including data ingestion, data quality, data masking, and stream processing. BDM provides a graphical user interface for generating ETL mappings (jobs) and workflows for various frameworks, such as Spark, Hive on MapReduce, or Hive on Tez. You install BDM on an edge node in your Hadoop cluster, and use it to create jobs and workflows that ingest data into your cluster. The BDM interface allows you to construct jobs graphically, by connecting data sources to mappings to data destinations; BDM creates Hive or Spark queries for you, which removes the need for you to know Hive or Spark programming. However, while a non-programmatic interface is convenient, the jobs BDM generates might need tweaking to improve their performance or to meet your SLAs. Optimizing these BDM-generated data workflows can be complex and a resource drain for many customers. This is where Unravel comes in. The Unravel UI shows more information for each BDM job or workflow than YARN or your cluster manager does. This topic explains how to connect Unravel to your BDM jobs and workflows, so that Unravel can provide operational insights, recommendations, and automation to maximize their performance. You've already installed Informatica BDM on an edge node in your cluster. You've already installed Unravel Server on an edge node in your cluster.

Once the example script is issued, the application metadata is displayed. Use the app id listed in the metadata to locate the app in Unravel UI. Recommendations are deployment specific so you need to edit the Spark properties in the example script-number -after.sh scripts as suggested in the Recommendations tab of Unravel UI. The categories of recommendations and insights are: actionable recommendations (examples 1, 2 , and 5)* Spark SQL (example 3) error view and insights for failed applications (example4) and recommendations for caching (example 5) *if running Benchmarks 2.0.x, example 6 is an actionable recommendation. Sample Spark recommendations Execute the edited *-after script, that includes the Spark configuration properties as suggested in the Recommendations tab of the Unravel UI. $ .\/example $ -after.sh After running the sample, check whether the re-execution of the script improved the performance or resource efficiency of the application. You can also check the Program and the Execution Graph tabs in Unravel UI. Click an RDD in the Execution Graph to see the corresponding line of code in the app. Example 5 In order to run this script you must enable insights for caching, which are disabled by default as it consumes additional heap from the memory allocation of the Spark worker daemon. You should enable insights for caching only if you expect that caching will improve performance of your Spark application. Add the following property to \/usr\/local\/unravel\/etc\/unravel.properties on the Unravel server node: com.unraveldata.spark.events.enableCaching=true Restart the spark worker daemon. sudo \/etc\/init.d\/unravel_sw_1 restart Repeat step 9 - 12.

How Unravel helps select the number of partitions and container sizes for best performance, e.g., increasing the number of partitions and reducing per-container memory resources. example2 A Scala-based application which generates its input and applies multiple transformations to the generated data. How Unravel helps select the container sizes for best performance, in other words, reducing per-container memory resources. example3 A Scala program containing a SparkSQL query. The program runs TPC-H Query #9 on a 10GB database. How Unravel helps select the number of executors for best performance when dynamic allocation is disabled. For example, increasing the number of executors. example4 A Scala-based application. This application generates its input and applies multiple transformations to the generated data. How Unravel helps to root-cause a failed application. For example, failure-related insights and Error View when the application runs out of memory. example5 A Scala-based application. The application runs on an input of 2GB and applies multiple join and co-group transformations on the input data. Certain RDDs are evaluated multiple times. Pre-requirement : Add the property com.unraveldata.spark.events.enableCaching=true to unravel.properties file to enable caching. This property is disabled by default as it consumes additional heap from the memory allocation of the Spark worker daemon. Enable it only if caching related insights are considered for tuning performance of Spark applications. Unravelâ€™s insights for caching by showing the caching opportunities within the application, i.e., where in the program to use persist() to cache the corresponding RDD. In this example, dynamic allocation is disabled. Benchmarks for 2.0.x Example Demonstrates example1 see example1 in Benchmarks for Spark 1.6.x example2 A Scala-based application which generates its input and applies multiple transformations to the generated data including the coalesce transformation which reduces the level of parallelism to a suboptimal value.

"body" : "A private certificate authority (CA) is often used for signing certificates of non-public machines. Unravel server contains a bundled JRE that has well-known, public CAs. In order for Unravel to make REST requests to collect cluster metadata from HTTPS endpoints, it needs to know about your private CA. Use one of the techniques below and restart all Unravel daemons with sudo \/etc\/init.d\/unravel_all.sh restart after making the change. \/path\/to\/jks_keystore is the path for your local settings. Externally managed JKS keystore The bundled JRE will use an external keystore ( jssecacerts ) in preference over the built-in one ( cacerts ). Simply create a symlink as shown to your JKS keystore: # chmod 444 \/path\/to\/jks_keystore\n# ln -s {\/path\/to\/jks_keystore} \/usr\/local\/unravel\/jre\/lib\/security\/jssecacerts Note: Substitute \/path\/to\/jks_keystore and ensure that the target file is updated whenever your CA certificates are updated. Externally managed JRE or JDK with curated cacerts An external JRE or JDK is often maintained for local use so that the cacerts or file it contains is up-to-date. If this is convenient, you can edit \/usr\/local\/unravel\/etc\/unravel.ext.sh and change the line for JAVA_HOME. Java 1.8 is required. The environment variable should point to the directory that contains bin\/java . If you are using unlimited encryption strength for your Hadoop services, be sure that the JRE\/JDK you specify also has unlimited encryption strength. Substitute your local settings \/usr\/java\/jdkl1.8 . For example: export JAVA_HOME \/usr\/java\/jdk1.8 Adding a CA certificate to bundled JRE You can add a CA certificate to the JRE that is bundled with Unravel server. First, copy cacerts to jssecacerts so that an upgrade of Unravel will preserve your change: # cd \/usr\/local\/unravel\/jre\/lib\/security\n# sudo cp -p cacerts jssecacerts List contents of the jssecacerts keystore: # sudo \/usr\/local\/unravel\/jre\/bin\/keytool -list -keystore jssecacerts Import\/insert a new certificate: Substitute your local values for mycompanyca and something.cer when you execute this command. Afterwards, repeat the listing step to see the effect of the insert. # sudo \/usr\/local\/unravel\/jre\/bin\/keytool -keystore jssecacerts -importcert -alias mycompanyca -file something.cer \n# sudo \/usr\/local\/unravel\/jre\/bin\/keytool -list -keystore jssecacerts " },

This topic explains how to configure them to make them available through the Unravel UI. This feature runs as hdfs user and uses Hive to insert FSimage data into tables. Small Files and Files Reports can be turned off. See the enable\/disable section for toggle the status of the reports. 1 - Determine how Unravel will access FSimage. Unravel can run as hdfs admin. This allows Unravel to access the FSimage on the Namenode using the hdfs dfsadmin command. See Running Unravel Daemons with Custom User to configure Unravel to run as hdfs admin. For CDH: Check to see if Unravel user has hdfs admin permission. hdfs dfsadmin -report If Unravel has hdfs admin permission, immediately go to Step 2 , otherwise locate Unravel's group name. id unravel Go to CDH HDFS configs page. Locate the Superuser Group property and change the value to result obtained in step 2 above. Unravel can not run as hdfs admin . This is the most common setup. The FSimage must be downloaded for Unravel to generate these reports. Create a cron to download it to the Unravel server. The download can take up to 10 hours depending on the size of FSimage. The time can determine how often cron is\/should be run. If the raw FSimage can be parsed faster into a tab delimited file using the HDFS OIV utility, that can also be part of the cron job. The old image must be deleted before running the cron job. Unravel uses this image to create the report. Therefore, the Small Files and Files reports are analyzing a snapshot, which with the passage of time becomes outdated.

If upgrading from Unravel 4.5.2.x or earlier just perform steps 2, 8 and 9. Grant dfsadmin privilege or this alternative to the Unravel user. To grant this privilege, set\/update the HDFS configuration property dfs.cluster.administrators and restart all services affected by this change. If you can't grant dfsadmin privilege to the Unravel user, follow the steps in the Troubleshooting section of Triggering an import of FSImage . These steps allow Unravel to use the FSImage you import manually. Remove the following line from \/usr\/local\/unravel\/ondemand\/unravel-python-1.0.0\/scripts\/hive_queries_reporting\/hive_properties.hive : ADD JAR {UDF_JAR_LOC}\/ unravel-udf-0.2.jar This line is no longer required because UDFs jars are stored locally on the HiveServer2 node in Sentry-secured CDH clusters. For Unravel versions, 4.5.x and earlier, remove ADD JAR {UDF_JAR_LOC}\/unravel-udf-0.1.jar. Allow the Unravel user to submit Hive queries to a YARN queue. If you can't allow this on your default YARN queue, you can grant this permission on a different YARN queue: Create a different YARN queue for the Unravel user. Give the Unravel user permission to submit Hive queries to the new YARN queue. In unravel.properties on Unravel Server, set unravel.python.reporting.files.hive_mr_queue to the new YARN queue. For details on this property, see Unravel Properties. Create a new Sentry role, unravel_role , using the beeline CLI as the Hive admin user (hive by default). create role unravel_role Map the unravel group to unravel_role : grant role unravel_role to group unravel Set HDFS access privileges for the Unravel user: The Unravel user needs to copy FSImage to \/tmp\/fsimage , so allow this access as follows: grant all on uri 'hdfs:\/\/\/tmp\/fsimage' to role unravel_role; Grant the Unravel user the following privileges on the Hive tables under the default database: Create\/drop\/truncate\/alter Hive tables Run\/select\/insert queries on Hive tables Alternatively, you can: Use a different database for the Unravel user, such as unravel_db . Give the Unravel user the above permissions on that database: grant all on database unravel_db to role unravel_role; In unravel.properties on Unravel Server, set unravel.python.reporting.files.hive_database to the alternate database. For details on this property, see Unravel Properties. For example, unravel.python.reporting.files.hive_database=unravel_db Add a JAR and create temporary UDFs: As the Unravel user, copy the Unravel JAR, \/usr\/local\/unravel\/ondemand\/unravel-python-1.0.0\/jars\/fsimage_reports\/unravel-udf-0.2.jar , to the HiveServer2 aux JAR path. For Unravel versions4.5.x and earlier, use \/usr\/local\/unravel\/ondemand\/unravel-python-1.0.0\/jars\/fsimage_reports\/unravel-udf-0.1.jar . The HiveServer2 aux JAR path is specified by the Hive Auxillary Jars directory (in a Hive Service wide configuration) OR by hive.reloadable.aux.jars.path (in a Hive Server2 hive_site.xml configuration). Get your settings from Cloudera Manager. The goal is to get the JAR into the path HiveServer2 recognizes for aux JARs.

"body" : "The etl_fsimage task imports the latest FSimage from Namenode and incorporates it into a Hive table ( unravel_hdfs_fsimage_master_orc ) used for Unravel's Small Files\/File Reports feature, and it also generates four (4) precomputed file reports. We recommend scheduling etl_fsimage for a daily run (which is the default configuration). The default configuration leads to triggering of etl_fsimage at 00:00 UTC every day. As of 4.5.3.0 you can configure the time and interval for downloading the FSimage, see FSimage properties . However, there may be times when you want to import FSimage immediately, such as after Unravel Server is installed or upgraded. In this case, you have to start etl_fsimage manually by running the following script on the Unravel node: curl -v http:\/\/localhost:5000\/small-files-etl This script ensures that the latest FSImage is incorporated in Unravel's Small Files\/File Reports. The etl_fsimage task's run time is proportional to the size of FSImage. In testing on a single node cluster, we observe the following run times. Please note that these times may not match your deployment; these times illustrate that etl_fsimage is proportional to the size of FSimage. FSImage Size etl_fsimage Run Time 19 GB 24 hours 9 GB 14 hours 4 GB 7 hours Troubleshooting If etl_fsimage fails with the warning OR if the Unravel user does not have dfsadmin privileges --i.e. you see the following error: [2018-09-10 23:11:57,357: WARNING\/ForkPoolWorker-1]* stderr: sudo: hdfs: command not found* In this case, do the following: Fetch the FSImage as a user with dfadmin privileges using the commands rm -rf unravel_node_fsimage_dir\/*\nhdfs dfsadmin -fetchImage unravel_node_fsimage_dir These commands delete all existing FSImage files and then copy the latest FSImage into the directory you specify ( unravel_node_fsimage_dir ). The directory unravel_node_fsimage_dir must be different then Unravel's default directory \/srv\/unravel\/tmp\/reports\/fsimage and it should be readable by unravel user. Best practice is to run these commands in a cron job that completes before Unravel's etl_fsimage task is triggered every day at 00:00 UTC. Configure Unravel OnDemand to access FSImage from unravel_node_fsimage_dir by setting the following properties in unravel.properties : unravel.python.reporting.files.skip_fetch_fsimage=true\nunravel.python.reporting.files.external_fsimage_dir=unravel_node_fsimage_dir Note: For this to work, the OnDemand user must have read privileges for the directory specified by unravel_node_fsimage_dir.

Connecting to your Airflow Web UI In \/usr\/local\/unravel\/etc\/unravel.properties , update or add these properties: HTTP for Airflow Web UI access If your Airflow Web UI uses HTTP, set these properties: com.unraveldata.airflow.protocol=http\ncom.unraveldata.airflow.server.url= airflow-ui-url \ncom.unraveldata.airflow.available=true\n HTTPS for Airflow Web UI access If your Airflow Web UI uses HTTPS, set these properties: com.unraveldata.airflow.server.url= airflow-ui-url \ncom.unraveldata.airflow.available=true\ncom.unraveldata.airflow.login.name= airflow-ui-userame \ncom.unraveldata.airflow.login.password= airflow-ui-password \n Property\/Description Set by user Unit Default com.unraveldata.airflow.available Notes if the airflow is currently available. false : not available true : available boolean false airflow.look.back.num.days The number of days to look back. The look-back days can be specified as a positive or negative number. For instance -5 or 5 sets the look back number of days to 5. count 1 airflow.look.back.num.hours The look-back time window in hours, which can be either a positive or negative integer. If present, it takes precedence over airflow.look.back.num.days to have finer granularity. Suggested value for large clusters: 2 count 24 com.unraveldata.airflow.http.max.body.size.byte Set maximum number of bytes Unravel fetches data from Airflow Web UI. Default unlimited. bytes 0 com.unraveldata.airflow.login.name Airflow UI login username. You must set this if airflow.server.url = https. Required string - com.unraveldata.airflow.login.password Password for Airflow UI com.unraveldata.airflow.login.name . You must set set this if airflow.login.name is set. Required string - com.unraveldata.airflow.protocol Type of connection, e.g., HTTPS or HTTP. You must set the airflow.login.name and airflow.login.password when this value is https. https com.unraveldata.airflow.server.url Full URL of the airflow server, starting with http:\/\/ and https:\/\/ . url http:\/\/localhost:10080 com.unraveldata.airflow.status.timeout.sec Set Airflow workflow status timeout in Unravel. sec 3600 com.unraveldata.airflow.task.log.parsing.enabled Controls whether to parse the Airflow Task logs. These logs are used to populate the Workflow Instance entities in the \"Jobs - Workflows\" page. boolean true com.unraveldata.airflow.task.log.parsing.operators Controls the Task logs to parse based on the Operator that produced it. Since Unravel only derives insights for Hive, Spark, and MR applications, it is set to only analyze operators that can launch those types of jobs. The values are delimited using a \",\" and it treats \"*\" as a wildcard to many any or no characters. Any special characters like \"\\\" or \".\" will be removed. string BashOperator, PythonOperator, *Hive*, *Spark* com.unraveldata.airflow.task.thread.pool.size Controls whether to process the Airflow Task logs sequentially or in parallel. Process the logs in parallel improves performance. This config takes effect only if airflow.task.log.parsing.enabled =true. Possible values are 1-16. If one, logs are processed sequentially. If greater than one, logs are processed in parallel using a Thread Pool with of the size specified value. count 1 Restart unravel_jcs2daemon . sudo \/etc\/init.d\/unravel_jcs2 restart Changing the Monitoring Window By default, Unravel Server ingests all the workflows that started within the last five (5) days. You change the date range to the last X days. Open \/usr\/local\/unravel\/etc\/unravel.properties and update the following property. If you can't find it, add it. Note there’s a “-” (minus sign) in the value. airflow.look.back.num.days=-X Restart the unravel_jcs2daemon . sudo \/etc\/init.d\/unravel_jcs2 restart Enabling AirFlow Here is a sample script, spark-test.py , for Spark. spark-test.py from airflow import DAG\nfrom airflow.operators.bash_operator import BashOperator\nfrom airflow.operators import PythonOperator\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta\nimport subprocess\n\n\ndefault_args = {\n 'owner': 'airflow',\n 'depends_on_past': False,\n 'start_date': datetime(2015, 6, 1),\n 'email': ['airflow@airflow.com'],\n 'email_on_failure': False,\n 'email_on_retry': False,\n 'retries': 1,\n 'retry_delay': timedelta(minutes=5),\n # 'queue': 'bash_queue',\n # 'pool': 'backfill',\n # 'priority_weight': 10,\n # 'end_date': datetime(2016, 1, 1),\n}\n In Airflow, workflows are represented by directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). For example, dag = DAG('spark-test', default_args=default_args)\n Add hooks for Unravel instrumentation. The following script, example-hdp-client.sh , adds hooks for Unravel instrumentation by setting three Unravel-specific configuration parameters for Spark applications. spark.driver.extraJavaOptions spark.executor.extraJavaOptions spark.unravel.server.hostport We recommend setting these parameters on a per-application basis only when you want to monitor\/profile certain applications, rather than all the applications running in the cluster. Alternatively, you can specify these parameters in spark-defaults.conf . This script can be invoked to submit an Airflow Spark application via spark-submit . It references the following variables, which need to be changed to values valid for your local environment. PATH_TO_SPARK_EXAMPLE_JAR =\/usr\/hdp\/2.3.6.0-3796\/spark\/lib\/spark-examples-*.jar UNRAVEL_SERVER_IP_PORT =10.20.30.40:4043 SPARK_EVENT_LOG_DIR =hdfs:\/\/ip-10-0-0-21.ec2.internal:8020\/user\/ec2-user\/eventlog example-hdp-client.sh hdfs dfs -rmr pair.parquet\nspark-submit \\\n--class org.apache.spark.examples.sql.RDDRelation \\\n--master yarn-cluster \\\n--conf \"spark.driver.extraJavaOptions=-javaagent:\/usr\/local\/unravel_client\/btrace-agent.jar=unsafe=true,stdout=false,noServer=true,startupRetransform=false,bootClassPath=\/usr\/local\/unravel_client\/unravel-boot.jar,systemClassPath=\/usr\/local\/unravel_client\/unravel-sys.jar,scriptOutputFile=\/dev\/null,script=DriverProbe.class:SQLProbe.class -Dcom.sun.btrace.FileClient.flush=-1 -Dcom.unraveldata.spark.sensor.disableLiveUpdates=true\" \\\n--conf \"spark.executor.extraJavaOptions=-javaagent:\/usr\/local\/unravel_client\/btrace-agent.jar=unsafe=true,stdout=false,noServer=true,startupRetransform=false,bootClassPath=\/usr\/local\/unravel_client\/unravel-boot.jar,systemClassPath=\/usr\/local\/unravel_client\/unravel-sys.jar,scriptOutputFile=\/dev\/null,script=ExecutorProbe.class -Dcom.sun.btrace.FileClient.flush=-1\" \\\n--conf \"spark.unravel.server.hostport=$UNRAVEL_SERVER_IP_PORT\" \\\n--conf \"spark.eventLog.dir=$SPARK_EVENT_LOG_DIR\" \\\n--conf \"spark.eventLog.enabled=true\" \\\n$PATH_TO_SPARK_EXAMPLE_JAR Submit the workflow. Operators (also called tasks) determine execution order (dependencies). In the example below, t1 and t2 are operators created by BashOperator or PythonOperator . They invoke example-hdp-client.sh , that submits the workflow for execution. Note: The path name of example-hdp-client.sh is relative to the current directory, not to ~\/airflow\/dags as in the Airflow operator above. t1 = BashOperator(\ntask_id='example-hdp-client',\nbash_command=\"example-scripts\/example-hdp-client.sh\",\nretries=3,\ndag=dag)\n\n\ndef spark_callback(**kwargs):\nsp\n = subprocess.Popen(['\/bin\/bash', \n'airflow\/dags\/example-scripts\/example-hdp-client.sh'], \nstdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.STDOUT)\nprint sp.stdout.read()\n\n\nt2 = PythonOperator(\ntask_id='example-python-call',\nprovide_context=True,\npython_callable=spark_callback,\nretries=1,\ndag=dag)\n\n\nt2.set_upstream(t1)\n You can test the operators first.

"body" : "Unravel's metBackup , is a utility for creating backups and archives for the metric database. Alternatively, you can use PostgreSQL pg_dump utility. The metBackup is run on demand, either periodically as a cron job or as needed. It creates a single tar file containing the data backup. When a table or a partition is backed-up or archived, a log entry noting the time of the backup is added to the part_log file. The backup is not validated. metBackup takes advantage of the fact that frozen partitions are immutable and need to be backed-up only once. Optionally active partitions, i.e., not-yet-frozen, and the non-partitioned tables (node_desc, metric_desc, and part_log) can be backed-up. The metBackup utility is invoked through the script met_backup.sh . met_backup.sh [options] By default, regardless of data creation date, only frozen partitions are backed-up, if and only if, they were not previously backed-up. Options -f backupFile Name of backup tar file. Default metBackup_currentTimeAsEpoch . -d startDateAsEpoch Backup only data created on or after this date. -a Backup active partitions and the non-partitioned tables, node_desc, metric_desc, and part_log. -z Backup frozen data, regardless of whether it was previously backed-up. The retire thread is responsible for removing partitions past their expiration date. The normal procedure to retire the partition is to detach it from the parent table and delete it. When archiving is enabled (see the doArchive configuration property): Archived partitions are detached and deleted. Non-archived partitions are detached. The part_log is then periodically checked to see if the partition has been archived. Once archived, the partition is deleted. " },

"body" : "Unravel AutoActions is managed by the AutoAction daemon, unravel_aa , which you can stop, restart, and configure. There are no restrictions and the daemon can be stopped and started any time. Upon restart it synchronizes with the metric stream automatically and will continue to process data and enforce Auto Action policies. Stopping\/starting or restarting the daemon may cause some data loss though and some violation events may be missed. You may want to stop the daemon if you do not want to use AutoActions or if they are not supported for your platform. Currently, AutoActions is supported for every platform except Unravel for Azure Databricks. You must be logged onto the Unravel server to start, stop, restart the daemon or configure the properties. To stop the daemon. sudo service unravel_aa stop To start the daemon. sudo service unravel_aa start To restart the daemon. sudo service unravel_aa restart Configure the daemon by resetting the one or more of the following properties in unravel.properties . Any changes and deviation from the default values should be done with extreme care as it can drastically change the behavior of the daemon and may cause unexpected results. It is always advisable to consult Unravel Support before making any adjustments. After making changes to the any of the properties, you must restart the daemon for them to take effect. Property\/Description Set by user Unit Default com.unraveldata.auto.action.enable.policy.enforce.in.jcs Enables AutoActions to be processed under the legacy (pre-4.5.2.0) mode of operation when AutoAction enforcement resided in JCS2 daemon. This works for on-prem mode only. When using this mode you can stop AutoAction daemon. boolean false com.unraveldata.auto.action.max.buffered.group.count A message group represents one complete YARN metrics polling cycle. It is incomplete when it has missing messages, messages out of order, etc. This property controls how many message groups can be buffered while waiting for completion of the current group. Once the daemon has buffered the max.buffered.group.count , it either drops or accepts the incomplete group (see max.lost.messages.count ) and moves onto processing the next group. Setting this value higher than 1 may increase latency of enforcement of an Auto Actions but can help to alleviate errors in message transport protocol. count 1 com.unraveldata.auto.action.max.lost.messages.count Maximum number of lost messages a group can have and still be be accepted for aggregation and policy enforcement. Accepting incomplete groups lowers the consistency of triggered violations but lets the daemon to operate with an “unstable” connection. 0: only complete groups are accepted. > 0: groups missing up to X messages are accepted. count 0 com.unraveldata.auto.action.metric.discard.ms When a incoming metric's timestamp is older than this value it is not processed but discarded. This mechanism is designed to deal with Kafka latency, consumer lags and other message delivery delays. It prevents the daemon from acting on outdated data and issuing false-positive violation events that are irrelevant at the present time ms 3600000 (1 hour) com.unraveldata.auto.action.policy.db.update.skip.cycle Defines how often the daemon refreshes the AutoAction policy definitions when aggregating and enforcing per enforcement cycle (see enforce.period.ms ). 0: All policies are read every time the daemon's ready to aggregate and enforce policies. > 0: The policies are read every X cycle. For instance, 1: the daemon reads them every other cycle, 2: every third period and so on. Changing this value makes sense only if there are a lot of policies defined. count 0 com.unraveldata.auto.action.policy.enforce.period.ms Maximum wait period for policy enforcement to be triggered. AutoAction metric aggregation and enforcement cycle is driven by metric producers, i.e., the daemon synchronizes with the metric polling cycles for each monitored cluster. When no YARN metrics are delivered or accepted and therefore policies are not getting evaluated for longer than this period, the daemon will forcibly execute metric aggregation and policy enforcement to process other internal Unravel metrics, such as Workflow, Hive, Tez, Impala metrics. ms 180000 (3 min) com.unraveldata.auto.action.transport.receiver.ttl.ms Identifies how long a transport protocol connection remains active without receiving any data from the cluster. If no metrics are received for longer than this value, the cluster is considered terminated and connection is closed on the receiver (daemon's) side. ms 1800000 (30 minutes) " },

"body" : "This topics explains how to configure Pagerduty and your Unravel server in order to receive auto action notifications via Pagerduty. The auto action's template provides the ability to send alerts via email to one or more recipients and\/or create a HTTP endpoint allowing integration with a third party tool, e.g., Slack. These two options are specified when creating\/editing an auto action. Once entered nothing further needs to be done for notifications to be sent. Unravel has developed a third option allowing you to use Pagerduty to send notifications to one or more users through Unravel's auto actions API . Currently, this action is initiated outside of Unravel's server. For the integration you need to complete two (2) setups: Set up a service at Pagerduty and specify who should be notified and how (email, etc.), and Run a python script on your local machine, specifying the Unravel server and Pagerduty information. The python script must be running with the correct parameters in order for pagerduty to receive and forward notifications. Set up a Pagerduty service Login to your Pagerduty Account. Select the Configuration pulldown menu and chose Services . You can register at Pager Duty . Select Add New Service . Name the new service. Select Use our API directly and chose Events API v2 from the pull down menu. Use the defaults for the remaining options and click Add Service . Copy the Integration Key from the Service Details Integrations tab as you need it for Unravel's Auto Actions API. Run the Unravel API python script on your local computer Download the Unravel demo program to the directory of your choice on your local machine. # git clone https:\/\/github.com\/Unravel-Andy\/unravel-api-demo-v1 cd to unravel-api-demo-v1 . # cd unravel-api-demo-v1\n# ls\nREADME.md Run the python script to bring up the Unravel API Demo window Enter your Unravel Server's address in Unravel Autoactions API Address text box. The Autoactions API address has the form of http[s]:\/\/UNRAVEL_HOST_IP\/api\/v1\/autocactions . Substitute a fully qualified DNS or IP address for UNRAVEL_HOST_IP . In the example below the server is https:\/\/playground.unraveldata.com. Enter the pagerduty integration key in the Pagerduty API key text box. Be sure to enter in the integration key correctly ensure a connection with Pagerduty. An incorrect key, or spaces around the key will prevent connecting with Pagerduty. Click Start to populate the window with the defined auto actions and their status. These are sorted on status first and then alphabetically in ascending order. To scroll within list, click within the Autoaction Name list and scroll. Open your browser and login to the Unravel Server you entered above. Navigate to the Auto Actions page ( Manage | Auto Actions ). See Creating Auto Actions if you don't know how to navigate to Auto Actions. The Unravel UI shows the same list of active and inactive Auto Actions listed in Unravel API window. Both the Unravel API window and the Unravel UI shows the exact same list of Autoactions and their status. Toggle one of the autoactions to see the effect. In our example there were 2 active autoactions, Kill job hogging the cluster and Rogue App AA #1. We deactivated Kill job hogging the cluster . In the UI and Unravel API window, you will see the change. Kill job hogging the cluster was moved to the inactive status\/list in both the Unravel UI and Unravel Autoactions API window. Updated Unravel UI Updated Unravel API - In both screenshots below, Kill job hogging the cluster is shown inactive. The one on the left shows a successful connection to pagerduty, so notification was made. The shot on the right shows a failed connection with no notification made. The key was invalid because a space was added to the end of the string. Pagerduty, upon receiving the status change information, will transmit it to the parties specified in the service detail. Sample sms message Sample email The python script must be running with the correct parameters in order for pagerduty to receive and forward notifications. " },

While it is possible to use RBAC without defining applications tags, its usefulness is limited. See What is tagging? if you are not familiar with the concept of tagging and how to generate tags for Unravel to use. The end-user's access is restricted based upon three factors Tags for the end-user You can create tags for Applications - See Tagging applications . Workflows - See Tagging workflows . End-users are then associated with the tags via LDAP or SAML. See com.unraveldata.login.mode . When RBAC is turned on an end-user's view is filtered based upon their tags.

"body" : "Tagging is a method to apply more context to your applications so you can view and organize them with more specificity based upon your requirements and needs. There are two types of tags: Application tags provide ways to filter applications. Workflow tags logically group a set of applications. Application tagging By the time your application reaches the cluster much of its context is lost, e.g., the dept which submitted it, what project it belongs to, etc. Available metadata by default All applications have the following metadata. (See how the metadata fields are populated .) App type App Id App Name Username Cluster (empty for server-less applications) Queue (empty for server-less applications) Configuration (accessible for some applications) As an admin you need to be able to organize\/view the applications running on the cluster with more granularity than this limited set allows. You will want to “slice and dice\" applications a myriad of ways for a variety of reasons. Unravel can not “magically” deduce which applications belong to what tenants, projects, teams, etc. to gain such granularity you must provide Unravel with this information. Tagging an app is how you tell Unravel about its context. What is a tag At the basic level a tag is simply a < key , value > pair which is associated with an application. A simple way to conceptualize tagging is to think of a spreadsheet. The key is the column header and the value an entry in the column. For each application you enter your value, if any, in the column. The following example has two keys, Tenant and Project, which can be used to filter applications. While an app can have multiple tags, it cannot have multiple values for a given key. In this example, an app cannot be tagged with proj1 and proj2 , App Type App ID App Name User Cluster Queue Tenant Project MR j_134 distc John def root.UM-proj1.print marketing proj1 Spark s_345 rate.spark.sim Jane def root.UM-proj2.print sales proj2 Spark s_456 over.spark.sim Jane def root.UM-proj3.print sales proj3 See the following Example for an explanation of how these tags were generated. Effective use of tags You can use tags to: Generate chargeback reports based upon specific criteria, e.g., project, dept, team, etc. Decide which apps a specific user can see, e.g., the marketing head can see all marketing apps, while user2 can only see specific marketing project apps. Group applications together. (See Tagging workflows .) In order to effectively use tags you need to understand your requirements for displaying or grouping your apps. For example: Do you need chargebacks reports for each tenant in a multi-tenant cluster? Then apps must be tagged with the tenant it belongs to. Do applications need to be billed back to departments and teams? Apps need department and team tags. Do you want to allow some users to see all projects and others just a subset of the projects (see Role Based Access Control )? Apps must have the project tags. A specific tag can be used for different purposes. You can use the project tag to generate chargeback reports and filter views specific users. Assigning tags You generate a tagging dictionary via a Python script. Unravel then uses the dictionary to apply tags to the applications as you prescribe. But like Unravel, the only information you have about the application running on the cluster is its metadata. So how can you develop a script to tag specific applications; how can you determine and generate your < key , value > pairs? Methods to generate\/create tags for an application Naming conventions By creating naming conventions for app, queues, and cluster names you can embed information to use for your tags, e.g., placing all apps belonging to project-1 in the root.UM-proj1.print queue lets you extract the project name from the queue the app is in. Using the metadata You can use the app’s metadata to create the tag values, for example: Directly, e.g., <team, username > Parse it to extract information, e.g., <project, {extracted from queue name }> Concatenate metadata with other metadata or strings, e.g., <dept, { username }+ {extracted from app name } + string> External mapping information A tagging script can access files that contain further mapping information. e.g., maps projects to tenants. You can download example tagging scripts . (This is currently private; please contact Unravel Support .) Workflow tagging Workflow tags are much simpler than application tags. You use preexisting Unravel tags to create workflows, specifically unravel.workflow.name and unravel.workflow.utctimestamp . See Tagging workflows for more information on creating workflows. " },

First, an app’s queue is parsed to extract the project it belongs to. The project name is encoded between \"UM-\" and \" . \". Once extracted, the name was used as the project value . Next, the script accessed a file which mapped the project name ( value ) to the tenant ( key ). The script resulted in three applications being assigned tenant and project tags. " },

Unravel retrieves the script from the property com.unraveldata.app.tagging.script.path so you must define all your application tags in that file. You can also use this script to set workflow tags .

When using this mode you can stop AutoAction daemon. boolean false com.unraveldata.auto.action.max.buffered.group.count A message group represents one complete YARN metrics polling cycle. It is incomplete when it has missing messages, messages out of order, etc. This property controls how many message groups can be buffered while waiting for completion of the current group. Once the daemon has buffered the max.buffered.group.count , it either drops or accepts the incomplete group (see max.lost.messages.count ) and moves onto processing the next group.
